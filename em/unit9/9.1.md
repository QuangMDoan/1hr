## 9.1 Electric Potential Energy 

### explore how to find the electric potential energy of two point charges 

##### Electric Potential Energy: $U_E$

It can be helpful to comapre $U_E$ to gravitational potential energy $U_G$ 

Both require two objects in a system (a single charged object cannot have $U_E$, just like a single mass cannot have $U_G$)

Both are proportional to $\frac{1}{r}$ aka (inversely proportional to r)

$$U_E = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r}, \quad k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} = 9*10^9N \cdot m^2/C^2$$


$$U_G = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}, \quad G = 6.67*10^{-11}N \cdot m^2/kg^2$$

$U_E$ is a scalar quantity and can be negative, so if you have a negative cahrge, it must be accounted for in the equation. 

### Example 

Calculate the electric potential energy of two point charges placed 1.5cm apart. Charge 1 has a charge of +4C, and charge 2 has a charge of +6C

## 9.1.2 explore how to find the electric potential energy of a group of charges
