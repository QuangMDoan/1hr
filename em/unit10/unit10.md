# Unit 10 Conductors and Capacitors 

## 10.1 Electrostatics with conductors 

### 10.1.1 define a conductor and look at charge distribution on conductors of different shapes

### Conductors and Electrostatic equilibrium 

Insulators are materials in which electrons are not able to move freely. 

Conductors are materials in which electrons are able to move freely. 

Rank density of charge on the surface from most dense to least dense
C > D > E = B > 

### 10.1.2 look at characteristics of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium

- The electric field inside a uniform conductor is always zero because the charges spread out on the surface to be as farr away from each other as possible so there is no net electric field inside. 
- The electric field at the surface of a charged conductor is always directed perpendicular to the surfacce. 
- The electric potential of a conductor is constant from center to surface ( it has to be, because E = 0 inside)
- Conductors can be polarized.
- Only negative charges can move. If an object gains positive charge, it is because it has lost negative charge.
$$V_A = k\frac{q}{R} < k\frac{q}{r} = V_B,\quad R > r => \frac{q}{R} < \frac{q}{r}$$

### Takeaways: 

- Conductors will polarize 
- When a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium: 
  - Charges will spread out on the surface (evenly if the surface is symmetric like a sphere)
  - if all charge is on the surface of a conductor, the electric field is zero inside the conductor. 
  - The electric potential, V, will be constant from the center of a sphere to the surface, since E = 0 
  - Electric field lines will be perpendicular to the surface. 

## 10.2 Redistribution of charge between conductors 

### 10.2.1 discover how charge is transferred by conduction. 

In order for charge to transfer by conduction, two objects need to be in contact, 

if opposite charges are present some of the charge will cancel out. What's left is equally split between the two objects if the same size and shape. 

you will see a reference to ground in this process. A ground is simply a big sink or source for electrons like you or the earth. 

if you have a charged sphere and then ground it, the sphere will be drained of charge and become neutral. 

### 10.2.2 discover how charge is transferred by induction

**How to charge an object without without touching it**

A nuetral conductor will become polarized when placed near a charged object. This means that if the left side of a neutral conducting sphere is brought near a positively charged balloon, the left side of the sphere will polarize to negative and the right side of the sphere will polarize to positive. 

Ground: A large source or sink of electrons

The process of charging an object by induction requires multiple steps and is slightly differnt if you are charging one or two objects. 

**two sphere induction**

1. start with two neutral conducting spheres that are touching. 

2. bring a positively charged balloon  near a sphere, they will act as a single conductor, with negative charge on the left sphere and positive charge on the right. 

3. separate the spheres each sphere will have a separate sign of charge and that will redistribute across the sphere's surface. 

**single sphere induction**

1. hold a charged balloon close to a neutral conducting sphere. 
2. spphere will become polarized 
3. ground the sphere by touching it electrons from you will surge toward the sphere 
4. once you remove your hand, the charge redistributes and you will end up with a negatively charged sphere. 
   
## Capacitors

### 10.3.1 learn the basic components, purpose and uses of capacitors with a focus on parallel plate capacitors. 

- primary purpose of a capacitor is to store energy using the transfer of electrical charge carriers. 
- This energy is stored when a source of potential difference is used to move charge carriers from one location to another within the capacitor. 
- The ratio $(\frac{Q}{\Delta V})$ of charge stored to potential difference used to move the charge is called the capacitance, C, of the capacitor. 
- Capacitance is the property that defines the charge-storing capacity of a capacitor. 
- Capacitance is measure in the SI units of farads (F) or coulombs per volt. 

Predict what will happen to the lightbulb in the circuit when the switch is closed? 
the lightbulb will turn on for a bit than go out. 

Why does this happen?

This happens because the capacitor initially has no voltage on it, no charge stored on it so we have a $\Delta V = 12 V$ in the circuit thats what makes the charges move so we will get current and light the light bulb. once switch is closed battery charges capacitor and the capacitor now has 12 V of charge stored now there is a potential difference of 0V. So we go from a 12V to a 0 volt difference. That's why the lightbulb lit and then went out.   

### Uses of Capacitors 
- Capacitors have a variety of shapes and sizes, along with a variety of uses. 
- Camera flash: requires a large amount of energy in a short period of time that cannot be provided by a battery.
- Emergency computer shutdown
- Audio equipment 
- AC to DC converters
- Defribillator
- DRAM

### Components of Capacitors 
- inside a capacitor there are two conducting plates: the `anode (+)` and the `cathode (-)`
- These plates are separated by an insulating material 
- To fit the plates into a smaller area, they are wrapped into a cylindrical shape. 
- once a capacitor is manufactured, its capacitance cannot be changed. 
- The capacitance (C) of the capacitor is determined by the potential difference ($\Delta V$) and charge (Q) stored on either plate 
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
- primary focus is parallel capacitors 
- parallel plates can be separated by an insulating material. 

### 10.3.2 learn about the electric field between the parallel plates of a capacitor and how that field can be determined 

Gauss's laws can be used to determine the electric field for various shapes and symmetries fo charged objects. 

often, gauss's law is simplified greatly with a constant electric field and a symmetrical gaussian surface. 

The Gaussian surface used to determine an electric field is an imaginary surface and does not affect the electric field being determined. 

Gauss's law also uses the concept of electric flux, which is based on the charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. 

- When two parallel plates are charged, an electric field exists between them. 

- In this scenario with two "planes" of charge, the charge is only on one side of each plate due to Coulomb attraction. 

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$

  the strength of the electric field of a capacitor is:
- directly related to the surface charge density of either plate 
- directly related to the total quantity of charge on each plate

**Charged particles in electric field**

- if a charged particle, q, is placed in a uniform electric field with magnitude E, the charge will experience a force, electric force.
- $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$ 
- $E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0A}$

A manufacturing company is tasked with designing a capacitor with a capacitance (C) of $10 \mu F$ and a plate separation (d) of 1mm. The electric field (E) within the capacitor cannot exceed $6.8 * 10^5 N/C$, or the capacitor will be destroyed. So, the charge (Q) on the capacitor may not be more than $6 \mu C$

- A. Calculate the plate area that should be used to build this capacitor 
  $$E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$
  $$A = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 E} = \frac{6*10^-6 C}{8.85*10^{-12}C^2/Nm^2 * 6.8*10^5N/C}$$
- B. What could the manufacturing company do to get this capaciotr to fit on a circuit board? 
  
  Make the capacitor very narrow and long, place an insulating material between the plates, and roll it up into a cylindrical shape. 
- C. Calculate the potential difference needed to charge this capacitor. 
  
  $$ C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
  $$ \Delta V = \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{6*10^{-6} C}{10*10^{-6}F} = 0.6V$$

### 10.3.3 learn how the size and separation of the parallel plates of a capacitor affect its capacitance. 

- The capacitance of a capacitor is the ability of the capacitor to store charge. 
- the amount of charge stored on a capacitor depends on the potential difference used to move the charge, as well as on the capacitance of the capacitor. 
- Capacitance, C, is the ratio of the charge, Q, stored on either plate to the potential difference, $\Delta V$, used to move the charge in the capacitor. 
  $$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
- A capacitor is made from two plates (anode and cathode) separated by an insulating material. 
- Once a capacitor is manufactured, its capacitance is a fixed value. 
  
**Capacitance Lab** 
- To determine the relationships between capacitance (C), distance between plates (d), and area of the plates (A), we will use the setup shown. 
- aluminum foil is used as the plates of the capacitor. 
- Paper is used to separate the plates. 
- Cardboard is used under and on top to minimize outside influence.
- A capacitance meter is conected to the top and bottom sheets of aluminum foil. 
- The length and width of the aluminum foil is measured in meters using a ruler or meterstick. 
- The area of the plates is calculated by multiplying length and width of aluminum foil. 
- the top and bottom aluminum foil pieces are cut to be the same size. 

Results: 
- capacitance is inversely related to the distance between the two plates 
- The capacitance is directly related to the area of each plate. 

$$C \propto \frac{A}{d}$$

After much more data collection and experimentation, scientists were able to determine the equation that relates the variables together:

$$C = \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}$$
 
### 10.3.4 learn the relationships between the capacitance, charge, potential difference, and electric field of a capacitor. 

Review: 
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$$
$$E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$
$$C = \epsilon_0\frac{A}{d}$$
$$Q = \epsilon_0\frac{A\Delta V}{d}$$
$$Q = \epsilon_0\frac{A\Delta V}{d} $$
$$E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$
$$Q = E\epsilon_0A = \epsilon_0\frac{A\Delta V}{d} => E = \frac{\Delta V}{d}$$
$$ \Delta V = \frac{Qd}{\epsilon_0 A}$$

Takeaways: 
- E between the plates of a charged capacitor will nto change as long as the charge density does not change. 
- if the battery stays connected to a capaciotr whne the dimensions of the capacitor are changed, the potential differene between the plates will stay constant. 
- if the battery is disconnected from a capacitor after it is charged, the charge density of the plates stays constant when the dimensions of the capacitor are changed. 

### 10.3.5 Electric potential energy stored in a capacitor and how it relates to charge, capacitance, and potential difference. 

The electric potential energy (U) between two charged objects is directly proportional to the charge (q) of one of the objects and teh electric potential (V) of the other object. 

$$U_{1,2} = q_1V_2$$
$$\Delta U = q\Delta V$$
- This energy is stored when a source of potential difference ($\Delta V$) is used to move a total charge of Q from one location to another within the capacitor. 
- The ratio of charge stored to potential difference used to move the charge ($\frac{Q}{\Delta V}$) is called the capacitance (C) of the capacitor. 

$$ C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$ 
- The magnitude of work (W) done to move a charge carrier from one location to another in a constant electric field is equal to thec harge in electric potential energy (\Delta U) of that charge carrier. 

$$W = \Delta U$$
$$W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}$$
If the force is constant over a distance ($\Delta r$), 
$$W = F\Delta r \cos(\theta)$$
- The force (F) exerted on a charge (q) in an electirc field (E) is given by the equation $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$
- The electric field between the plates of a capacitor can be calculated using the equation 
  $$E = \frac{\Delta V}{d}$$

$$W = F\Delta r\cos\theta = qE\Delta r$$
$$W = qEd$$
$$\Delta U = qEd => \Delta U = q\Delta V$$
$$dU = dq\Delta V, \quad C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
$$\Delta V = \frac{Q}{C} => dU = \frac{qdq}{C}$$

To determine the total energy (U) stored in a capacitor, we can integrate the above equation. 
$$\int dU = \int_0^Q \frac{qdq}{C} => U = \int_0^Q \frac{qdq}{C}$$
$$U = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$

the electric potential energy ($U_c$) stored in a capacitor is proportional to the square of the charge (Q) on either plate and inversely proportional to the capacitance (C)

combine 
$$U_c = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$ 
with 
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
we can derive two more equations for the electric potential energy stored in a capacitor. 
$$U_C = \frac{Q^2}{2C} $$
$$U_C = \frac{(C\Delta V)^2}{2C} = \frac{1}{2}C(\Delta V)^2$$
$$U = \frac{1}{2}Q\Delta V$$

A capacitor with capacitance C has been charged so that it has a potential difference of $\Delta V$ and a charge of Q. What happens to the electric potential energy if the potential difference is doubled?

The potential energy is increased by a factor of 4 Because the capacitance of the capacitor cannot change, the electric potential energy is directly proportional to the square of the potential difference. 

$$\Delta V = 2700V$$
$$U_C = 300J$$
$$Q = ?$$

### Takeaways 
- The electric field that does the work to move charges from one plate of a capacitor to the other palte is created by a potential difference. 
- When a potential difference is used to move charge in a capacitor work is done to store energy in the capacitor. 
- There are three different equations for calculating the electric potential energy stored in a capacitor. 
$$U_C = \frac{Q^2}{2C} = \frac{1}{2}C \Delta V^2 = \frac{1}{2}Q \Delta V$$

## 10.4 Dielectrics 

### 10.4.1 learn about materials that can be placed between parallel plates of a capacitor and how these dielectrics affect the capacitance of a capacitor. 

The primary purpose of a capacitor is to store energy using the transfer of electrical charge. 

This energy is stored when a source of potential difference is used to move charge from one location to another within the capacitor. 

The ratio of charge stored to the potential difference used to move the charge ($\frac{Q}{\Delta V}$) is called the capacitance (C) of the capacitor. 

Capacitance is measured in Farads or coulombs per volt 

Capacitance can also be determined using the area of either parallel plate and the distance between the plates. 

$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} = \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}$$

### 10.4.2 how the dielectric material affects the electric field of a parallel plate capacitor. 

- A dielectric is an insulating material that becomes polarized between the charged plates of a capacitor. 
- The polarization of this dielectric material improves the ability of a capacitor to store charge due to Coulomb attraction. 
$$C = \Kappa \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}$$
- the electric field between the plates of a vacuum filled capacitor is 
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}$$

$$E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A} = \frac{\Delta V}{d}$$

so, the electric field E witha dielectric between its plates is less than the electric field with a vacuum between its plates 

$$E < E_0$$

$$\frac{E_0}{E}$$ 
is calculated, result is a numerical value without unit

This ratio of electric fields ($\frac{E_0}{E}$) is defined as the dielectric constant of the material. 

$$\Kappa = \frac{E_0}{E}$$

lightning 
- clouds and ground behave similarly to the plates of a capacitor. 
- when the charge builds up in the clouds increases, the electric field between the cloud and the ground also increases. 
- Eventually, the strength of the electric field is too great for the air to handle and it conducts the charge, creating a massive electric arc. 

Air requires an electric field of $E = 3*10^6 \, V/m$ before it will berak down and allow the transfer of charge. 
this maximum value of electric filed strengthf for a dielectric is called the dielectric strength of the material. 

filling a capacitor with a dielectric causes the dielectric material to be polarized. This creates an electric field within the dielectric that points in the oppposite direction of the capacitors electric field, thus decreasing the overall electric field of the capacitor. 

### 10.4.3 how the dieletric constant of a material can be experimentally determined

**Review**

- The polarization of a dielectric material improves the ability of a capacitor to store charge due to Coulomb attraction. 
- the capacitance of a capacitor is directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the material between its plates. 
- The capacitance of a capacitor can be calculated with the equation 
$$ C= \Kappa \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}$$
where $\Kappa$ is the dielectric constant of the material between its plates. 

A scientist needs to determine the dielectric constant of paper. She decides to collect enough data to make a graph and use the graph to determine the dielectric constant. 


A. Equipment needed to determine the electric constant: 
- Capacitance meter 
- ruler 
- textbook 
- aluminum foil 
- connecting wires 

B. Write an experimental procedure
- Cut two pieces of aluminum foil to have the same size as the paper in the textbook. Leave a small portion of each piece of foil to protrude out of the pages of the book. (This is to allow a connection for the capacitance meter).
- using a ruler, measure the sides of one of your aluminum foil pieces and record the dimensions of the foil in a data table. 
- Place one of the pieces of aluminum foil inside the textbook near the beginning of the book. 
- Place the second piece of aluminum goil in the book 250 pages after the other piece of aluminum foil. 
- using connecting wires, connect the capacitance meter to the tabs on each piece of aluminum foil. 
- turn the dial on the capacitance meter to the setting that gives the most accurate reading. 
- press down on the book to remove as much air between the pieces of paper as possible. 
- Using the ruler and keeping the pressure constant on the book, measure and record the distance between the two sheets of aluminum foil. 
- while still pushing down on the book and keeping the pressure constant, record the reading on the capacitance meter in the data table. 
- Disconnect the capacitance meter, and remove both pieces of aluminum foil from the setup. 
- Cut each piece of aluminum foil to a smaller but equal size. 
- measure the capacitance using the same procedure as the previous steps and use the same pressure on the top book as before. 
- repeat steps 2-12 to obtain a total of 10 sets of data. 

C. Which of collected data are necessary to make a linear graph to determine the dielectric constant of paper. 


### Takeaways 
- the dielectric constant of a material can be found experimentally. 
- The slope of a linear graph, combined with a known equation, can be used to find the value of a quantity. 
- The capacitance of the capacitor used in this video's experimental example would have been lower if there was no paper (dielectric) between the plates. 
- Without a dielectric, the slope of the graph would be less, because the capacitance with the same area would be less.
