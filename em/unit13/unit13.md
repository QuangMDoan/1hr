# Unit 13 Electromagnetic Inudction

## 13.1 Magnetic Flux 

### 13.1.1 expand the concept of flux to magnetic fields, discuss the vectors that come into play, and analyze a few conceptual questions. 

**FLUX**
- Flux is an amount of stuff going through an area 
- we've seen electric flux through a surface area: $\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$
- Now we have magnetic flux through a loop area: $\int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}$
- the $d\vec{A}$ vector points `perpendicular` to the area of the loop.

### Takeaways: 
Magnetic flux depends on: 
- Strength of the Magnetic Field $|\vec{B}|$
- Size of loop area exposed to magnetic field  $\int dA$
- Angle of loop in relation to the field $\theta$

### 13.1.2 calculate the magnetic flux for several common situations, and learn when we need to integrate (and when we don't)

### Takeaways: 

When to integrate for flux: 

We only need to integrate if the magnetic field isn't constant over the entire area (it depends on r, or width, etc)

## 13.2 Electromagnetic induction 
### 13.2.1 break down the various components that make up Faraday's law and work through some examples. 

**Ohm's law**

$$ I = \frac{\Delta V}{R}$$

**Faraday's Law**

A changing magnetic flux induces an emf in the system

$$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$

![](faraday.png)

Faraday's law says If I have a magnetic flux going through a loop of wire, I can induce an emf in that loop of wire. And an emf ends up making a current and a field.

But faraday's law says that if you change that flux, the active change induced a current or an emf in the loop of wire, so I can actually make the light bulb light up. 

**Loop and Wire FRQ**

Calculate the magnitude of the induced emf generated around the loop at time t = 3.0s. 

$$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$ 
$$\phi_B = \frac{\mu_0IL}{2\pi}ln(\frac{d+w}{d})$$

### Takeaways
- A changing magnetic flux induces an $emf = \Delta V = \epsilon$ in the system 
  - change the area (size or oreintation/angle)
  - change the field

### 13.2.2 introduce Lenz's law to determine the direction of induced current, using both the mathematical relationship and the "arrows and feathers" repsentation

**Faraday's Law**: a changing magnetic flux induces an emf in the system 

$$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$

**Lenz's Law**: An induced emf generates a current that creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux

A conducting rod is sliding at a speed of 4.5m/s along conducting rails that are 0.75m apart. The rails are attached to a 5.0$\Omega$ resistor, completing a loop. The loop is in a $250mT$ magnetic field that is directed out of the page, as shown. 

The current generated in the resistor is

### 13.2.3 discuss the collection of Maxwell's equations and what they tell us about electric and magnetic fields. 

Maxwell's Equations: 

Maxwell's Equations are the set of equations that fully describe electromagnetism

**Maxwell's First Equation**

Gauss's Law 

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$

$$\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

**Maxwell's Second Equation**

Gauss's Law for Magnetism 

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0$$

$$\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$$

**Maxwell's Third Equation**: 

Faraday's Law 

$$\text{emf} = \oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl} = - \frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$

$$\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$$

**Maxwell's fourth equation**

Ampere's Law
$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0I + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{d\phi_E}{dt}$$
$$\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} = \mu_0(\vec{J}+\epsilon_0\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}) $$

our integral of $B \cdot dl$ around a loop is $\mu_0I_{enc}$  
it's kind of like the magnetism version of Gauss's law

the Maxwell's addition says that you can have a magnetic field generated by an electric current. That's what Ampere's law is all about. 

A changing electric field in turn creates a magnetic field. 

## 13.3 Induced Currents and Magnetic forces. 

### 13.3.1 We will qualitatively investigate situations where an external magnetic field exerts a force on a conducting loop that is carrying an induced current. 

**Magnetic Forces on Charges**

A magnetic field exerts a force on charges moving through a field. 

$$\vec{F_M} = q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$$

**Magnetic Forces on Current-Carrying Wires**

If the charges are inside a wire carrying a current that is inside a magnetic field, they will also experience a force from the magnetic field. 

The sum of these can be represented by a single magnetic force on that wire. 

$$\vec{F_M} = \int_0^L I(d\vec{l} \times \vec{B})$$

**Induced emf Produces an Induced Current**

By Faraday's Law, a changing magnetic flux induces an emf in a conducting loop. 

$$|\epsilon| = N|\frac{d\Phi}{dt}|$$

By lenz's law, the current will be in a direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux. 

**Changing Flux Caused by Translational Motion**

- Magnetic field is constant, but defined edges exist. 
- A conducting rectangular loop is pulled out of the field. 
- This causes a change in flux, inducing an emf, resulting in an induced current. 
- By focusing on just the sections of wire inside the field, we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force. 

**Changing Flux caused by Rotational Motion**

- Squre loop is rotated about an axis and entirely inside a constant magnetic field with angular speed $\omega$
- As the loop rotates, magnetic flux changes, inducing an emf that results in an induced current. 
- As the area of the loop rotates and magnetic flux increases through the loop, an induced current results from the indcued emf. 
- By applying the right hand rule, a magnetic force exists on all four sides. 
- By symmtery, the forces on the top and bottom cancel. 
- This results in a net torque about the axis of rotation opposite the direction of its angular velocity. 

### 13.3.2

calculate the value of the magnetic force an external field exerts on a moving loop of wire carrying an induced current. 

- when a conducting loop moves out of a magnetic field, the magnetic flux inside the loop changes. 
- this induces an emf which induces a current in such a direction as to oppose the change. 
- by focusing on just the sections of the wire inside the field, we can use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force.
- By symmtery, the top and bottom forces cancel leaving a net magnetic force. 

What force is necessary to apply to pull the rectangular loop out of the magnetic field while maintaining a constant velocity?

- a = 0.15m 
- v = 0.50m/s
- N = 50
- R = 0.5$\Omega$
- B = 1.25T
  
As the loop exits the field, magnetic flux changes, resulting in an induced emf. 

$$|\epsilon| = N|\frac{d\Phi}{dt}|$$

$$\epsilon = N\frac{d(BA)}{dt} = NB\frac{d(A)}{dt} = NBa\frac{dx}{dt} = NBav$$

$$I = \frac{\epsilon}{R} = \frac{NBav}{R}$$

$$\vec{F_M} = \int_0^aI(d\vec{l}\times \vec{B})$$
$$|\vec{F}_M| = \int_0^a (I)(B)(dl)(\sin\theta)$$
$$F_M = IB\int_0^a dl$$
$$F_M = IB(a-0)$$
$$F_M = \frac{NB^2a^2v}{R}$$
$$F_M = 1.8N$$

By drawing a free body diagram, we can clearly see that to maintain a constant velocity, the force that we apply must be equal to the magnetic force induced on the loop. 

$$F_{app} = F_M = 1.8N$$

### 13.3.3 witness and explain a demonstration of an external field exertin a force on a moving conducting loop carrying an induced current. 

**Scenario Description**

- A cart with a coil of wire attached to the top of travels along a frictionless track. 
- As the cart travels the coil of wire will pass through a region with a constant magneti field present. 
- By application of the concepts of magnetic forces that result on induced forces in conducting loops, we should be able to predic the shape of the cart's velocity vs. time graph
- Assume the coil of wire has the same width as the region containing the magnetic field. 
- Three regions exist to analyze: 
  - Before the coil enters the magnetic field (`constant velocity`)
  - While the coil is entering/exiting
  - after the coil exits the field (`constant velocity`)

![alt text](<f1.png>)
- From the previous video, we determined the strength of the magnetic force induced to be: 

$$F_M = \frac{NB^2a^2}{R}v$$

- In this example, the magnetic force acts just like a resistive force discussed in Mechanics course: a velocity dependent force acting opposite the direction of velocity. 

$$F = -kv, \quad k = \frac{NB^2a^2}{R}$$

$$\sum F = ma = -\frac{NB^2a^2}{R}v$$

$$ma = -kv$$

$$m\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv$$

$$\frac{dv}{v} = -\frac{k}{m}dt$$
$$\int_{v_i}^{v_t} \frac{dv}{v} = -\frac{k}{m}\int_0^t dt$$
$$ln(v(t)) - ln(v_i) = -\frac{k}{m}t$$
$$ln(\frac{v(t)}{v_i}) = -\frac{k}{m}t$$
$$\frac{v(t)}{v_i} = v_ie^{-\frac{k}{m}t}$$
$$v(t) = v_ie^{-\frac{k}{m}t}$$

## 13.4 Inductance 

### 13.4.1 define inductance and inductors and derive an expression for the inductance of a solenoid. 

**The Parallel Plate Capacitor**

- The parallel plate capacitor, when charged, holds equal amount of positive and negative charges on either plate. 
- A constant electric field existed between the plates. 
- Based on this physical construction, the capacitor is a device that can store energy in its electric field. 

**The solenoid**

- The solenoid consists of a wire tightly wrapped around a cylindrical core to create a helical stack of conducting loops. 
- When a current is established in the solenoid, a magnetic field exists through the core. 
- The magnetic field strength inside the solenoid can be determined by the equation

$$B = \mu_0\frac{N}{l}I$$

**Inductance Defined**
- Solenoids resist changes in current. 
- As current increases the solenoids magnetic field will increase. 
- This changes flux which will induce an emf that produces a current in a direction that opposes that change in flux. 
- `Inductance`: The tendency of a conductor to resist a change in current. 

$$L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}$$
- Units of inductance: Henry 

$$H = \frac{Tm^2}{A}$$

**The Solenoid as an Inductor**
- Inductor: An electronic circuit element that possesses inductance. 
- We can define the inductance of a solenoid just by looking at its physical features. 
$$L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}$$
$$B = \mu_0\frac{N}{l}I$$
$$L = \frac{N(B_{sol}A\cos\theta)}{I}$$
$$L = \frac{NA}{I} \frac{\mu_0 N}{l}I = \frac{\mu_0N^2A}{l} = L_{sol}$$

**The Solenoid as an Inductor**

- A dielectric could increase the capacitance of a capacitor. 

$$C = \frac{\kappa\epsilon_0A}{d}$$

- A different material, other than air or a vacuum, in the core of a solenoid can increase its inductance. 

$$L_{sol} = \frac{\mu_{core}N^2A}{l}$$

### Takeaways

- Inductance is a property of a conductor to resist changes in current. 
- Inductance can be explained by the ararngement of loops resulting in a change in magnetic flux when external factors are changed. 
$$L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}$$
- A solenoid is a great example of an inductor 
- Like a capacitor, putting a different material inside a solenoid's core increases its inductance. 
$$L_{sol} = \frac{\mu_{core}N^2A}{l}$$

### 13.4.2 define the self-inductance of an inductor and derive an equation for the induced emf that exists when current changes. 

**Resisting changes in current**
- A solenoid with a current established in it produces a magnetic field through its core. 
- As current changes, increasing in this example, the magnetic field increases in strength. 
- This causes an induced current whose magnetic field opposes the change in the solenoid's flux. 

**Induced emf quantified**
- The outlined process explains the tendency of an inductor to oppose a change in current. 
- Direction of this emf will always oppose a change in current. 

$$\epsilon_L = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -\frac{d(N\Phi)}{dt}$$

$$L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}$$

$$LI = N\Phi$$

$$\epsilon_L = -\frac{d(N\Phi)}{dt} = -\frac{d(LI)}{dt}$$

$$\epsilon_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

**Induced emf in a Circuit**

- Inductors are used in circuits. 
- As current changes, the inductor self-induces an emf that will oppose any change in current. 
- If current increases, an emf is induced across the inductor. 
- if current decreases an emf is induced across the inductor. 

**Graphing Induced emf**

- The current through some inductor can be varied by its source and produces a current vs time graph as pictured to the right. 
- Determine the relative shape of the graph representing the induced emf vs time. 

$$\epsilon_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

### Takeaways

- An inductor will always induce an emf whenever current through its coils changes. 
- This induced emf will always act in a direction to oppose the change or maintain its present state
- it can be quantified using the equation 

$$\epsilon_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

### 13.4.3 Investigat the energy stored in an inductor's magnetic field by deriving an equation that relates stored energy, inductance, and current. 

- When a capacitor is charged it possesses some potential difference $\Delta V$ and an Electric field $\vec{E}$ exists between the plates. 
- Energy stored in this electric field 
$$U_C = \frac{1}{2}Q\Delta V$$

**Energy Storage Devices - The Solenoid**
- When a current exists inside the coils of a solenoid, a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ exists through the core of the solenoid. 
- Energy is stored in this magnetic field. 

- When we look at an application of an inductor in a simple circuit, we can quantify this energy stored in the field. 

**Determining Energy Stored in an Inductor**
`Kirchhoff's Loop Rule` is an expression of conservation of energy applied to single loops of circuits. 

$$\epsilon - \Delta V_R - \epsilon_L = 0$$
$$\epsilon - IR - L\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$$
$$I \cdot \epsilon - I \cdot IR - I \cdot L\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$$
Each term describes a rate at which energy is supplied, dissipated or stored. 
$$\epsilon I = I^2R + IL\frac{dI}{dt}$$
- $\epsilon I$ represents the power supplied to the circuit by the source emf
- $I^2R$ represents the rate at which energy is dissipated as thermal energy in the resistor. 
- $IL\frac{dl}{dt}$ must, by conservation of energy, represent the reate at which energy is being stored or dissipatted by the inductor. 
$$\frac{dU_L}{dt} = IL\frac{dl}{dt}$$
$$dU_L = ILdI$$
$$\int_0^{U_L} dU_L = \int_0^I ILdI$$
$$(U_L-0) = \frac{L(I^2-0^2)}{2}$$
$$U_L = \frac{LI^2}{2}$$

**Electircal Energy in a RL Circuit**

This energy can be dissipated through a resistor. 

### Takeaways 
- Like a capacitor stores energy, so does an inductor. 
- The equation to quantify the electrial stored in the inductor comes from a Kirchhoff's Loop Rule statement, ultimately an expression of conservation of energy. 
$$U_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
- This energy can be dissipated in a resistor or used to charge a capacitor. 

## 13.5 Circuits with Resistors and Inductors (LR Circuits) 

### 13.5.1 use Kirchhoff's loop rule to derive the current and voltage equations for LR circuits. 

**RL Circuit Schematic**

![alt text](<f3.png>)

$$L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2A}{l}$$

$$\Delta V_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

**Applying Kirchoffs loop rule**
$$\epsilon - \Delta V_R + \Delta V_L = 0$$
$$\epsilon -IR - L\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} = 0$$
$$\epsilon - IR = L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$\frac{1}{L}dt = \frac{dI}{\epsilon - IR}$$
...
$$I(t) = \frac{\epsilon}{R}(1-e^{-t/\tau})$$

tau is the time constant 

$$\tau = \frac{L}{R}$$
$$\Delta V_R(t) = I(t)R$$
$$= \epsilon(1-e^{-t/\tau})$$
$$\Delta V_2(t) = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$= \epsilon e^{-t/\tau}$$

### Takeaways 
- At time t = 0, the current in series with the inductor is 0 as the inductor opposes the rapid change in current. 
- after a long time, the inductor will no longer oppose the rapid change in current and will act like a wire. 
$$I(t) = I_{max}(1-e^{-t/\tau})$$
$$\tau = \frac{L}{R}, \quad I_{max} = \frac{\epsilon}{R}$$

$$\Delta V_R(t) = I(t)R$$
$$\Delta V_L(t) = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

### 13.5.2 look at how the energy stored in an inductor after steady state conditions are reached can then dissipate through a resistor. 

![alt text](f4.png)

**Storing Energy in an Inductor**

$$dE = Pdt = I\Delta Vdt$$
$$dE = I|L\frac{dI}{dt}|dt$$
$$dE = ILdI$$
$$E = \int_0^I LI'dI'$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

**Discharging Through a Resistor**
Open S1 close S2
$$\Delta V_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$\Delta V_L - \Delta V_R = 0$$
$$-L\frac{dI}{dt} - IR = 0$$
$$-L\frac{dI}{dt} = IR$$
$$I = Ce^{-t/\tau}$$
t = 0, I = $\frac{\epsilon}{R}$
$$I(t) = \frac{\epsilon}{R}e^{-t/\tau}$$

### Takeaways 
- The energy stored in a a current-carrying inductor is stored in the induced magnetic field and can be calculated by 
$$U_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

- Timing of switches can allow this energy to dissipate through a resistor, very similarly to how a capacitor would discharge through a resistor. 

### 13.5.3 analyze steady state conditions for various open/closed switch scenaiors involved in LR circuits. 

**Immediate conditions**

Both switches are closed 

- At t = 0s, we close both switches simultaneously
- Inductor acts like an open switch at t = 0s
- Current will flow through both resistors and switches, but not through the inductor. 
- Current measured from $A_1$ and $A_2$ is $\frac{\epsilon}{2R}$ and is moving from left to right in both ammeters. 

**Steady State Conditions**
- After a long time, inductor no longer opposes the rapid change in current through it. inductor will essentially act like a wire. Current measured by $A_1$ is $\frac{\epsilon}{R}$, moving from left to right through $A_1$
- After a long time, current measured by $A_2$ is zero. 
- Inductor acts like a wire after a long time, allowing current to flow from top to bottom.

**Immediate conditions**

open switch 1 at time t equals to zero 
Immediately after opening switch $S_1$, current in the inductor continues to be $\frac{\epsilon}{R}$ and moving downward through the inductor. 
- In this case, the inductor opposes the decrease in current from opening switch $S_1$
- Current measured in $A_2$ is $\frac{\epsilon}{R}$ moving from right to left through the ammeter and will decay to zero over time. 

### Takeaways:
At t = 0s 
- The inductor opposes a rapid change in current, with the potential difference expression as $\Delta V_L = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$
- The net current through the inductor will initially be zero, then start to gradually increase. 
- The inductor can be thought of as an open switch at this point, with no energy stored due to no current flow and no magnetic field present. 

After a long time 
- The inductor will no longer oppose the rapid change in current and the potential difference across the inductor will be zero. 
- The inductor can be thought of as a wire with neglgible resistance at this point, and there is energy stored in the inductor, which can be expressed as $U_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$ 
- An inductor that has a current flowing through it can then dissipate that energy through a resistor with an exponentially decaying current over time. 

$$I(t) = \frac{\epsilon}{R}e^{-t/\tau}$$

## 13.6 Circuits with Capacitors and Inductors 

### 13.6.1 explore relationships between potential energy stored in capacitors and inductors in an ideal LC circuit through the use of an experimental procedure. 

**Capacitors**
- Symbol C
- Unit: Farad(F)
- Equation $C = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{d}$
- Stores energy in its electric field
- $U_C = \frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^2$
- Initial charging acts like "wire"
- Steady charge acts like "opposing battery"

**Inductors**
- Schematic Symbol: L 
- Unit: Henry(H)
- Equation: $L = \frac{\mu_{core}N^2A}{l}$
- Stores energy in its magnetic field 
- $U_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$
- Initial current acts like "opposing battery"
- Steady current acts like "wire"

**LC Circuits (A model)**
- Circuits with only an `inductor (L)` and `Capacitor (C)` are known as LC circuits. 

**Lab Design**
Create a lab setup using the schematics shown at tright to "charge" the capacitor in an LC circuit and then control when to discharge. 

- This Circuit will charge the capacitor when S1 is closed, then with S1 open, close S2 to create the LC circuit. 
- Where should a voltmeter and ammeter be attached to determine the voltage of the capacitor and current in the circuit?

**Analyzing Data**
- The data is periodic
- No energy lost from circuit

$$U_{Cmax} = U_C + U_L = U_{Lmax}$$

**Solving for maximum current**

In circuits containing only a charged capacitor and an inductor, the maximum current through the inductor can be determined using conservation of energy within the circuit. 

$$\frac{1}{2}C\Delta V_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2}LI_{max}^2$$


| $V_C$(Volts)       |   I(Amps)     |
|----|---|
|10.0|0.0|
|7.0| 3.6|
|0.0| 5.0|
|-8.5|2.6|
|-9.5|1.6|
|-7.5|-3.3|
|-3.0|-4.8|
|4.0|-4.6|
|6.0|-4.0|
|9.0|-2.2|

![alt text](f5.png)
fitting a line to relate $I_{Max}$ with $V_{CMax}$
using 
$$\frac{1}{2}C \cdot V^2 = L \cdot I^2$$
$$\sqrt{C} \cdot V = \sqrt{L} \cdot I$$
$$I = \frac{\sqrt{C}}{\sqrt{L}}V + \text{Noise}$$
slope m = $\frac{\sqrt{C}}{\sqrt{L}} => L = \frac{C}{m^2}$



slope $m = 0.19 => L = \frac{0.1}{0.19^2} = 2.8H$

**Solving for maximum current**

A 0.4F capacitor is charged by a 9 volt battery. The capacitor is then disconnected from the battery and attached to a 1.6H inductor what is the maximum current in the circuit. 

### Takeaways 

- Circuits with only an `inductor (L)` and `Capacitor (C)` are known as lC circuits. 
- The maximum curren through the inductor in an LC circuit can be determined using conservation of energy within the circuit. 
- In an experiment there would be some resistance resulting in loss of energy over time, but treating all circuit components as ideal helps learn general properties LC circuits. 

### 13.6.2 derive simple harmonic nature of an ideal LC circuit and make claims based on its expected behavior. 

**Key Equations**

$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$
- C is capacitance 
- Q charge on plates of capacitor
- $\Delta V$: Potential difference across plates

$$\epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
- $\epsilon$ EMF across inductor 
- $L$: Inductance
- $\frac{dI}{dt}$: Time derivative of current 
  
$$I = \frac{dq}{dt}$$
- I: Current 
- \frac{dq}{dt}: Time derivative of charge 

**Simple Harmonic Motion Review**

A special case of periodict motion where restoring force is proportional to the object's displacement from equilibrium. 

- Mass-spring systems: $-kx = ma => -kx = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$
- simple pendulums: $-mgL\sin(\theta) = I\alpha => -g(\theta) = L\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$
- $\sin(\theta) = \theta$: small angle approximation

**Key Idea**

In circuits containing only a charged capacitor and an inductor (LC Circuits), the time dependence of the charge stored in the capacitor can be modeled as simple harmonic motion. 

Video 1 showed the current and voltage data was periodic. 

![alt text](f7.png)

**Kirchhoff's Loop Rules**
- Kirchoff's Loop rule: The sum of potential differences across all circuit elemetns in a single closed loop must equal zero. 

$$\Delta V_C - \Delta V_L = 0$$
$$\Delta V_L = \epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$\Delta V_C = \frac{Q}{C}$$
$$\frac{q}{C} -(-L\frac{dI}{dt}) = 0$$
$$L\frac{dI}{dt} = -\frac{q}{C}$$
$$I = \frac{dq}{dt} => \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{d^2q}{dt^2}$$
$$L\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\frac{q}{C}$$
$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\frac{1}{LC}q$$

- This is a second order linear differential equation
- This is a second order linear ODE

While the current in an LC circuit is as its maximum, what is true about the magnitude of the EMF of the inductor?
- the EMF is zero

$$\epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
- Maximum current occurs when instantaneous $\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$
- If current was still increasing or decreasing, it couldn't be the maximum!

### Takeaways 
- In LC Circuits the time dependence of the charge stored in the capacitor can be modeled as `simple harmonic motion. `
- The derived equation showing `SHM` for an LC Circuit is: 

$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\frac{1}{LC}q$$
- The equation is derived from Kirchhoff's Loop Rule using the potential difference for a capacitor and the EMF of an inductor. 

### 13.6.3 derive the angular frequency of an ideal LC circuit, and then compare and calculate the period of oscillation between various cases. 

**Key Equations**
$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\frac{1}{LC}q$$ 
- SHM for an LC circuit
$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\omega^2x$$
- In mechanics, this second order differential equation is derived for an object exhibiting SHM
- $\omega$: Angular Frequency
$$T = \frac{2\pi}{x}$$
- T: Period 

**Tying it together** 

The angular frequency of an oscillating LC circuit can be derived from the differential equation that describes an LC circuit.
$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\frac{1}{LC}q$$ 
$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} = -\omega^2q$$
$$\omega^2 = \frac{1}{LC}$$
$$\omega_{LC} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

$$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
$$T_{LC} = 2\pi \sqrt{LC}$$

$$T_S = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
$$T_P = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$

**Units "check-up" (AKA dimensional analysis)**
- L: Inductance - Henrys (H)
$$\epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt} => V = H\frac{A}{s} => H = \frac{Vs}{A} = \frac{Vs}{C/s} => Henry(H) = \frac{Vs^2}{C}$$

- C: Capacitance - Farads (F)
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} => Farad(F) = \frac{C}{V}$$

- T: Period (seconds/cycle)
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{LC}$$

$$s = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{Vs^2}{C}\frac{C}{V}}$$
$$s = s$$

This is a cosine function
- When we start with t = 0 the voltage across the capacitor is equal to $V_{CMax}$
- Some time later the current starts to flow, decreasing my voltage of the capacitor while my current increases to some point having no charge left on capacitor(When t = T/4)
- continuing forward I then go to half the overall period where now my charge has gone form the top plate to the bottom plate flipping the voltage of my capacitor. 
- As I keep going now my current flows the opposite direction where I eventually have no charge stored on the capacitor (t = 3T/4) maximum magnetic field of my inductor.  Gives 0 voltage across the capacitor. 
- And once again I continue until I get back to the same point. 

This forms a cosince function which is periodic. Why this is indeed Simple Harmonic Motion, or SHM. 

$$T_A > T_B, \quad T = 2\pi\sqrt{LC}$$

Higher Period -> Higher Capacitance 

$$C_A > C_B$$

- Voltage doesn't affect the period of oscillation. 
- The period of oscillation is proportional to $\sqrt{L}$ and $\sqrt{C}$

**Calculating Capacitance**

What is the capacitance, C, of the capacitor?
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{LC}$$
$$24*10^{-3}s = 2\pi\sqrt{0.8}*\sqrt{C}$$
$$C = (\frac{24*10^{-3}}{2\pi\sqrt{0.8}})^2 $$
$$C = 1.82*10^{-5}F$$

What is the maximum voltage of the capacitor?
$$U_{CMax} = U_{LMax}$$
$$\frac{1}{2}C\Delta V_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2}LI_{max}^2$$
$$\Delta V_{max} = I_{max}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} $$
$$\Delta V_{max} = (12*10^{-6}A)\sqrt{\frac{0.8H}{1.82*10^{-5}F}}$$
$$\Delta V_{max} = 2.5mV$$
$$\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$
$$\omega^2 = \frac{1}{LC}$$
$$25 = \frac{1}{0.4*C}$$
$$C = \frac{1}{0.4*25}$$
$$C = \frac{1}{10}$$
