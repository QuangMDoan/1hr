## 11.1 Electric Current 

### 11.1 What makes electric current and what causes it to occur 

the number of coulombs of charge that move through an area in an given time is used to measure electric current. 

- Notice that the electic current is still a measurement of a quantity (number) over a period of time. 

- Electric current $(I)$ is the amount of charge $(Q)$ moving through a cross sectional area of a wire in an time interval $(\Delta t)$

$$I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{dq}{dt}$$

- Electric current is measure in Amps or Amperes (A), which is the number of coulombs of charge per second $(C/s)$

$$A = \frac{C}{s}$$

the electric current depends on the following: 
  - Number of charged particles per cubic meter of volume
  - Quantity of charge
  - cross sectional area of wire 

$$I = nqv_d A$$

in the equation, $n$ represents the number of charged particles per cubic meter of volume, $q$ is the quantity of charge, $v_d$ is the drift velocity of the charged particles, and $A$ is the cross sectional area of the wire. 

- To have a current in a wire, there must also be a pressure difference, otherwise known as an electric potential difference, between the ends of the wire. 

$$\Delta V => I $$

This electric potential difference is sometimes also referred to as an electromotive force or emf $(\epsilon)$

### 11.1.2 learn about electric current density and its relationship to an electric field 

**Review**

Electric current is the movement of electric charge carriers through a material 

In a wire, the electric charges move with many different velocities. 

The net motion of the electric charge carriers in a wire is called the drift velocity $v_d$

$$I = nqv_d A$$

$$I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{dq}{dt}$$

$$\frac{I}{A} \quad \text{ratio is the electric current density in the wire}$$

symbol used for electric current density is 
$$J = \frac{I}{A}$$

units for electric current density is $\frac{A}{m^2}$

$$\vec{J} = \frac{I}{A} = \frac{nqv_dA}{A} = nq\vec{v_d}$$

the drift velocity is a vector quantity so the electric current density is also a vector quantity.

if electric charges positive electric current density is in the same direction as the drift velocity 

What if the area vector was not parallel to the electric current density vector? 

$$I = \vec{J} \cdot \vec{A} = JA\cos(\theta)$$

What happens if the current passing through an infinitely small area needs to be determined? 

Let the area vector of an infinitely small area be $d\vec{A}$

The electric current equation would become: 

$$I = \int \vec{J} \cdot d\vec{A}$$

What causes charge flow? 

- If current density is a vector quantity, then there must be something that causes the charges to flow in a particular direction. 
- "something" that causes the charges to flow in a particular direction is electric potential difference, or emf. 
- An electric potential difference sets up an electric field that points from the area of high electric potential to an area of low electric potential. 
- a charge located within an electric field will experience a force. 
- If the strength of the electric field is increased, the force is increased, which increases the electric current density. 
- the electric field and the current electric density are directly related to each other. 
- They differ from each other by a factor known as the resistivity of the material from which the wire is made. 
- The greater the resistivity the lower the electric current density. 
  $$\vec{E} = \rho\vec{J}$$
  where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material.

A copper wire with a cross sectional area of $4*10^{-6}m^2$ has a free electron density of $8.4 * 10^28m^{-3}$. The electrons in the wire have a drift velocity of $3.4*10^{-6}$m/s to the right. What is the electric current density in the wire?

### Takeaways 

- Electric current density $J = \frac{I}{A}$
- The magnitude of the electric current density is $J = nqv_d$
- Electric current density is a vector quantity with a direction equal to the drift velocity deirection if the charges are positive and in the opposite direction if the charges ar enegative. 
- Electric current is the scalar/dot product of the electric current density and cross-sectional area vectors. 
  $$ I = \int \vec{J} \cdot d\vec{A}$$

- Electric current density is related to the electric field 
$$\vec{E} = \rho\vec{J}$$ 
where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the conductor. 

### 11.1.3 lean if electric current has a direction and what it means to have a direction 

- Electric current is the flow of electric charges through a conducting material. 
- Electric current is the result of the scalar/dot product of the electric current density and area vectors. 

$$I = \vec{J} \cdot \vec{A} = JA\cos(\theta)$$

The direction of conventional current is based on positive charges movement

### 11.1.4 learn how to solve a problem when the electric current density in a conductor is not constant. 

If the electric current density is no constant throughout the wire then we would need to use the equation 

$$I = \int \vec{J} \cdot d\vec{A}$$

suppose we have a wire with radius of two mm and has an electric current density that varies with radial distance $r$ as $J = ar^2$, in which $a = 1.5*10^{10} A/m^4$ and r is in meters. 

What would be the current through the outer portion of the wire between R/2 and R?

## 11.2 Simple Circuits 

### 11.2.1 learn about the components of a simple circuit. 

- The electric current in a wire is based on positive charge flow 
- electric potential difference sets up an electric field in a wire. 
- electric field applies a force to the charges taht causes them to move through the wire. 
- in order to have an electric current there must be an electric potential difference across the ends of the wire. 
- What causes this electric potential difference? 
- batteris and generators
- for simple circuits the electric potential difference is most commonly provided by a battery. 
- once a wire is connected to a battery, the battery provides the electric potential difference that sets up the electric field in the wire to move the charges in the wire. 
- Any time there is an complete loop of conducting material for which electric current can flow, it is called an electric circuit. 

a simple circuit is composed of electrical loops, whcih can include the following either individually or in combinations: 
- wires, batteries, resistors, lightbulbs, capacitors
- inductors, switches, ammeters, voltmeters 

with the switch at the open position the lightbulb does not light. 
This is because there is no co mplete loop through which the current can flow. 

when the switch is closed the lightbulb will light. 

This is known as a closed circuit. 

Why does the lightbulb not light even though the switch is closed and the circuit is complete? 

- the extra wire causes what is known as a short circuit. 
- The extra wire provides another loop for all the electric current to flow that has no change in electric potential difference. 
- as a result no current flows through the light bulb. 

### Takeaways
- A simple circuit is any electric loop that consists of a variety of devices through which electric current can flow. 
- an open circuit is an electric circuit through wich electric charges are not able to flow. 
- a closed circuit is an electric circuit through which electri charges are able to flow. 
- a short circuit is an electric circuit through which electric charges are able to flow but have no change in electric potential difference. 

### 11.2.2 learn the symbols for elements in an electric circuit and how electric circuit are represented using schematic diagrams. 

`electric circuit schematic diagram` also known as circuit schematics, circuit diagrams, or schematic diagrams shows how the electric circuit elements are connected or wired together. 

They are used to describe and analyze electric circuits. 

- any wire is represented by a straight line that connect from one element to the next, typically at right angles. 
- the symbol for a battery, or series of batteries, uses a long line to represent the high electric potential side of the battery and a short line for the low electric potential side. 
- typically the valu of the battery voltage is written near the symbol on the diagram. 
- resistors the colored band on each resistor are used to determine the value of the resistance using a color code. 
- The symbol for a resistor is a jagged line. 
- the value of the resistor can also be written near the symbol of the resistor. 
- symbol for a lightbulb is a circle with a loop in the circle. 
- the value of the lightbulb wattage and/or the amount of voltage dropped across the lightbulb is sometimes written near the symbol. 

- the symbol for capacitor has two parallel equal length lines. 
- the symbol for any inductor is a coil between two lines. 

symbols for devices
- inductor 
- resistor
- variable resistor: a jagged line with an arrow
- capacitor 
- battery 
- wire 
- light bulb 
- open switch 
- closed switch 
- ammeter: a circle with a letter "A" in it
- voltmeter: a circle with a letter "v" in it 

the correct symbol to use for a capacitor is two parallel lines of same length so D

## 11.3 Resistance, resistivity, and ohms law

### 11.3.1 what resistance is and its role in a circuit. strategies for working with resistance. 

when the series circuit shown to the right is connected, Bulb A is brighter than Bulb B. If the positions of the bulbs were reversed A is still brighter than B. 

`Resistance` is the opposition of charges moving through a circuit. 
- Symbol $\mathbf{R}$, unit $\mathbf{\Omega}$

`Ohm meter` is a device used to measure resistance. 
- the resistor does not need to be part of this circuit to measure resistance. 

### Takeaways 
- Resistors clog up the flow of charges
- current may slow down, but the charges speed up within the resistor 
- faster charges mean more collisions 
- more collisions mean energy is being transferred from the circuit
- any device that transforms electrical energy to some other type of energy can be a resistor in a circuit

### 11.3.2 explore resistance further. we'll also derive a mathematical expression that will allow us to predict resistance for a material. 

**Warm Up**

Roll a piece of modeling clay into a cylinder and use an ohmmeter to measure its resistance. 

Now roll it out until it's twice as long and measure the resistance again. Compared with the initial resistance, the new resistance is. 

`Cross sectional Area` - the area of a slice of a 2-dimensional shape that was cut by a plane in the 3rd dimension. 

`Resistance` - the limiting of charges moving through a circuit. Symbol `R`, unit $\Omega$ 

`Current Density`- Total current per unit Area. 
Symbol $J$, unit $A/m^2$

`Resistivity` - property of material that allows for the prediction of resistance based on the cross sectional area and length of the conductor. Symbol $\rho$, unit $\Omega/m$

`Resistance (R)` is a property of a conductor that impedes the flow of electric current.

R can be thought as the ratio of Voltage $(V)$ across the conductor to the current $(I)$ flowing through it. 


$$R = \frac{\Delta V}{I}$$

**Derive an expression for resistance**

electric field represents the force experienced by a unit positive charge at a given point in space. 

So, for a conductor of length L, the voltage can be expressed as 
$$V = -\int Edr$$
integrating the electric field over the length of the conductor

$$E_x = -\frac{dV}{dx}$$

$$E = \frac{\Delta V}{L}$$

Where $E$, is electric field, $V$ is electric potential and $x/r$ is a distance or length. 

$$\Delta V = -\int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}$$

Current density represents the amount of electric current passing through a unit area perpendicular to the current flow. 

Mathematically, 
$$J = \frac{I}{A}$$
where $I$ is the current and $A$ is the cross sectional  area. 

$$I = nqv_dA$$
- `n` represents the number of charge
- `q` is the fundamental charge 
- $v_d$ is the drift velocity 
- $A$ is the cross sectional area 

$$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$$

Resistivity is the ratio of Electric Field (E) to Charge density (J), we call this resistivity ($\rho$) solved for the electric field: 

$$\vec{E} = \rho \vec{J}$$

$$\vec{E} = \rho \vec{J}$$
$$\frac{\Delta V}{l} = \rho\frac{I}{A}$$
$$\frac{\Delta V}{l} = \rho\frac{\Delta V}{RA}$$
$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$

### Takeaways 

- electric field is the potential difference divided by the length of the conductor 
$$E = \frac{\Delta V}{r}$$
- Current density is current per unit area 
$$J = \frac{\Delta I}{A}$$
- Resistance is voltage over current
$$R = \frac{\Delta V}{I}$$
- Resistivity is a characteristic of a material. The inverse of resistivity is conductivity 
$$E = \rho J$$
- The resistivity of a material stays the same until a chemical change has taken place. 

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

### 11.3.3 resistance for parallel and series circuits 

- `series circuit` identifiable by charges having only one direction to choose 
- `Parallel circuit` identifiable by the presence of a junction, or intersection. 

**Parallel Circuits**

When in parallel, the equivalent resistance decreases
$$\frac{1}{R_{eq,p}} = \sum_i \frac{1}{R_i}$$

the potential difference across each resistor is the same as they are connected directly to the same two points on a circuit. 

electrons can flow through each resistor independently following the potential gradietn established by the applied voltage. The actual distribution of current among the resistors is determined by the relative values of their resistance. 

resistors with lower resistance will alow more current to flow through them. 

**Ohms law does apply to power lines**

the high voltages that characterize power lines between adjacent wires, not between the ends of the wires. The relatively low voltage across the ends of a single wire and low current accounts for small power dissipated in the wire. 

the much greater power delivered by the lines, however, is the voltage difference between adjacent wires multiplied by the current in them. This power is transmitted to the load. where currents and voltages are again in accord with Ohm's law. 

## 11.4 Electric Power

### 11.4.1 define power and its role in an electrical circuit. analyze graphs related to power to further understand this useful way of tracking energy. 

**Vocabulary**
- `Power`- the rate of energy dissipation or transformation. 
  - Symbol P, unit W (watt). 
- `Work`: the transformation of energy from one form to another 

$$P_{avg} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$
$$P_{inst} = \frac{dW}{dt}$$

the change in potential energy 
$$\Delta U_E = q \Delta V$$

$$P_{avg} = \frac{\Delta U_E}{\Delta t} = \frac{q\Delta V}{\Delta t}$$


$$P_{avg} = \frac{q\Delta V}{\Delta t}, \quad \frac{q}{\Delta t} = I$$

$$=> P = I\Delta V$$

$$I = \frac{\Delta V}{R}$$
so 
$$ P = \frac{\Delta V^2}{R}$$

$$\Delta V = IR => P = I^2R$$

**Warm Up**

The 40-watt bulb and the 100-watt bulb are connected in series to the battery 

Which bulb will glow brighter?

the 40 watt bulb will glow brighter when connected in series. 

To understand this we must first understand that the filament in a 40-watt bulb is thinner and therefore of higher resistance than the filament of a 100-watt bulb. It is the higher resistance of the 40-watt bulb that keeps the current to only 40/100 the current in a 100-watt bulb when both are properly connected in parallel. 

Then more current flows in the 100-watt bulb and it glow brighter. But when connected in series, the current is less but is the same in each. The same amount of current "squeezing" through the finer filament of the 40-watt bulb heats it more and makes it glow brighter than the lower-resistance 100-watt bulb. 

### Takeaways
- Power is the rate that energy is transformed, converted, or dissipated and is measure in joules/second, or watts: $P = I\Delta V$'
- Power also determines the brightness of a lightbulb, measured in watts. 
- Using Ohm's law, and if there is a constant voltage $P = \frac{\Delta V^2}{R}$
- Using Ohm's Law, and if there is a constant current, $P = I^2R$


### 11.4.2 further analyze power, especially in regards to lightbulbs. We'll aslo learn how to predic the brightness of a bulb depending on what our circuit looks like. 

- `Filament` - a thin, conducting material with a high melting point and very high resistivity used to create an incandescent light bulb
- `Incandescence` - the production of light by heating a filament until it glow
  
## 11.5 Compound DC circuits 

### 11.5.1 calculate equivalent resistance in series and parallel combinations. find current and voltage across each resistor. 

### 11.5.2 compare ideal vs. non-ideal batteries and wires, and discuss how those affect our circuita analyses. 

**ideal battery**

$$\Delta V =  \epsilon$$

Terminal voltage same as emf 

**non ideal battery** has internal resistance

Terminal Voltage 
$$\Delta V_{terminal} = \epsilon - IR$$

we found out there is an internal resistor using a load resistor when we increased the resistance the $\Delta V_{load}$ changed 

then we linearized the graph. 

the value of the slope was $\frac{r}{\epsilon}$

r is the internal resistance 

emf is the total voltage difference

### 11.5.3 discuss ammeters and voltmeters, including waht makes them ideal and how to hook them up in a circuit. 

**Ammeter**: a tool used to measure current at a specific point in a circuit. 

- Ammeters must be connected in `series` with the element in which current is being measured 

**Voltmeter**: A tool used to measure electric potential difference (voltage)  between two points in a circuit. 

- Voltmeters must be connected in `parallel` with the element across which voltage is being measured. 
- Ideal voltmeters have infinite resistance so that no charge flow through them. 

## 11.6 Kirchoff's Loop Rule 

### 11.6.1 discuss conservation of energy and how that leads to Kirchoff's loop rule. also look at graphs of voltage vs. position in the circuit. 

$$\Delta U_E = q\Delta V$$

**Kirchhoff's Loop Rule**
- if a single charge makes a complete loop around the circuit, conservation of energy says $\Delta U_E = 0$
$$\sum \Delta V = 0$$

$$\sum \Delta V = + V_{battery} - V_{resistor} = 0$$

### 11.6.2 learn the rules for making Kirchhoff loops, and apply them to circuits without junctions. 

**Steps to write Kirchhoff's Loops**

1. Choose a starting point. The loop must start and end at the same point. 
2. Sketch in currents. Direction does not matter!
3. Sketch in loops. 
4. follow your loop. Use the chart on the next slide to determine if voltage contribution is positive or negative. 

`Battery`: 
1. loop goes from negative to positive terminal +V
2. loop goes from positive to negative terminal -V

`Resistor`: 
1. loop and current are in the same direction: -V
2. Loop and current are in opposite direction: +V

## 11.7 Kirchoff's Junction Rule

### 11.7.1 discuss  conservation of charge, and how it leads to Kirchhoff's junction rule

**Kirchoff's Junction Rule**
$$\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$$

### 11.7.2 use Kirchhoff's loop and junction rules to solve complex circuits. 

## 11.8 Resistor-Capacitor Circuits

### 11.8.1 find the equivalent capacitance in series and parallel, as well as their indvidual potential differences and plate charges. 

**capacitors in series**
- have the same charge as the whole circuit

$$\frac{1}{C_{eq,series}} = \sum_n \frac{1}{C_n} = \frac{1}{C_1} + ... + \frac{1}{C_n}$$

$$Q = C\Delta V$$

$$V_C = \frac{Q}{C}$$

**Capacitors in Parallel**

- Current has multiple paths it could travel- Different charge!
- Potential difference is the same across all capacitors i.e. same voltage 
- More paths = More Capacitance 
$$C_{eq,parallel} = \sum_n C_n = C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n$$

### 11.8.2 use Kirchhoff's loop rule to derive the current and voltage equations for RC circuits. 

**Kirchoff's Loop Rule**
- a complete loop around a circuit has a potential difference of zero 
$$ \sum \Delta V = 0$$

**Voltage across resistor**
$$\Delta V = IR$$

**Voltage across capacitor**
$$\Delta V = \frac{Q}{C}$$

Use Kirchhoff's Loop Rule to create the differential equaitons taht describe RC circuits. 

### 11.8.3 analyze steady state conditions for various open/closed switch scenarios. 
- voltage across a charging capacitor
$$V_c(t) = V_b(1-e^{-t/RC})$$

- charge on a charging capacitor
$$Q(t) = CV_b(1-e^{-t/RC})$$

- voltage acrosss the resistor when charging capacitor
$$V_R(t) = V_be^{-t/RC}$$

- current through resistor when charging capacitor
$$I(t) = \frac{V_b}{R}e^{-t/RC}$$

- Voltage across a discharging capacitor
$$V_c(t) = V_be^{-t/RC}$$

- charge on a discharging capacitor
$$Q(t) = Q_0e^{-t/RC}$$

- voltage acrosss the resistor when discharging capacitor
$$V_R(t) = V_be^{-t/RC}$$

- current through resistor when discharging capacitor
$$I(t) = -\frac{V_b}{R}e^{-t/RC}$$

### 11.8.4. analyze non steady state conditions for various open/closed switch scenarios. 

**RC time constant**

The time constant of an RC circuit is a measure of how quickly the capacitor will charge or dischage. 

$$\tau = R_{eq}C_{eq}$$

how much time do you get to 63% of your maximum charge?

ans: when $t = RC$

t = RC is also the time needed to discharge to 37 percent of the maximum charge. 

how do you know which equation to use: 

$$e^{-t/RC} \quad \text{vs. } \quad 1-e^{-t/RC}$$

if the capacitor is emptying aka losing charges, then use 

$$e^{-t/RC}$$

otherwise use
$$1-e^{-t/RC}$$
