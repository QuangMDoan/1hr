# Magnetic Fields and Electromagnetism

## 12.1 Magnetic fields 

### 12.1.1 describe the properties of magnetic field and create magnetic field maps. 

- A `magnetic field` is a vector field that describes the magnetic forc exerted on moving charges, electric currents, or magnetic materials. 
- magnetic fields are created by `magnetic dipoles` or combinations of dipoles 
- a magnetic dipole has both north and south polarities.
- magnetic field lines allow us to visualize the magnetic field around a magnetic dipole or a magnetic object. 
- magnetic field lines point from a north pole to a south pole. 
- magnetic field lines will always form a closed loop through a dipole

**Gauss's Law**
Gauss's law for electric field states that the electric field through a closed surface is directly proportional to the charge enclosed by that surface. This is Maxwells first equation. 

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$

Because magnetic poles always occur as dipoles, the total of any dipole in an enclosed surface will be zero. 

This is `Gauss's Law` for magnetism, Maxwell's second equation: 

$$\oint B \cdot dA = 0$$

- the net magnetic field through any closed  surface will be zero. 
- magnetic fields exists as closed loops through `magnetic dipoles. `

A bar magnet is composed of multipole magnetic dipoles and has a north pole and south pole. 

**magnets** 

The magnetic field inside of a bar magnet points from south to north. 

A compass will align itself with a magnetic field and show the field's direction at a point in space. 

by moving a compass around a magnet, we can see the direction of the magnetic field outside of the magnet. 

Repeating these measurements over and over will yield a diagram showing the overall shape of the magnetic field. 

**Magnetic Field Lines**

Iron filings sprinkled onto the paper show the magnetic field around the bar magnet. 

Compasses placed around the magnet align themselves to the magnetic field. 

### 12.1.2 analyze the magnetic field created by a magnetic dipole and look at the effect of a magnetic field on magnetized objects. 

- **magnetic dipoles** are created by the rotational motion of electric charge carriers. 

- `Spin` is a fundamental property of an electron. Electron spin can be up or down. 
- The spin of an electron creates a magnetic field as shown. 

**Magnetic Dipole Moments**
- Magnetic dipole moments are also created by the circular motion of electric charge carriers. 
- In this example, an electron moves in a circle. As it does so, it creates a magnetic dipole moment as shown. 

**Magnetic dipoles**
- Because the circular motion or rotational motion of charge carriers create magnetic dipoles, magnetic poles always occur in pairs. 
- north and south poles can't be separated
- magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field may experience a torque from the magnetic field. 
- This torque can cause the dipole to align with the magnetic field. 
- this is similar to the action of a compass in a magnetic field. 

**Magnetism in materials**
- moment refers to the turning effect of a force about a point or axis. It's a measure of how much a force casues an object to rotate rather than just move in a straight line. 
$$Moment = Force \times \text{Perpendicular distance from the pivot}$$
- magnetic dipole moments exist in all materials. 
- The magnetic moments in nonmagnetic materials point in random directions. 
- these reandomly arranged magnetic dipoles cancel each other out, and these materials do not exhibit a net magnetic field. 
- the magnetic moments in permanent magnets point in the same direction. 
- the magnetic moments add together, and these materials exhibit a net magnetic field. 
- In some materials, magnetic dipole moments can move to align themselves in the presence of an external magnetic field. 
- These materials exhibit magnetism only the presence of an external magnetic field. 
- this is called induced magnetism. 

**Earth's Magnetic field**

The magnetic field around the Earth is caused by the motion of charge carriers inside the earths core. 

what is the current polarity of the north pole. 

- The Earth's geographic "North Pole" is a magnetic south pole. 
- The north pole of a compass or any isolated magnet is attracted to the Earth's "North Pole."
- Opposite poles attract: north poles are attracted to south poles. 
- When a compass aligns itself with an external magnetic field, its north end points in the direction of the field. Magnetic fields point away from north magnetic poles and towar dsouth magnetic poles. 

### 12.1.3 discuss the effect a material's composition has on its magnetic field and define magnetic permeability. 

- `magnetic permeability` describes a substances ability to form internal magneti fields. 
- empty space has its own magnetic permeability, aka vacuum permeability. It is known as the permeability of free space: 
$$\mu_0 = 4\pi * 10^{-7} N/A^2$$
- this is a fundamental physical constant that is important when quantifying the magnetic field created by a moving charge carrier. 
- ratio of material's permeability to vacuum permability we can determine relative permeability
$$\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}$$

A materials relative permeability gives us an indication of how magnetic that material is. 

`Nonmagnetic` materials have relative permeabilities very close to 1 and can be classified as `diamagnetic` or `paramagnetic. `

**Paramagnetism**

- In most materials, the net magnetic dipole moment from an `electron's spin` is cancelled by a paired electron with opposite spin. 
- in some materials with unpaired or free electrons, these magnetic dipole moments do not cancel. - These unpaired electrons have a net magnetic dipole moment. 
- paramagnetic materials, like aluminum, gold, and copper are magnetic in the presence of a magnetic field and are nonmagnetic in the absence of one. 

**Ferromagnetism**
- The magnetic moments in a ferromagnetic material align in the absence of external magnetic fields. 
- these areas of alignment are called magnetic domains
- these domains can have random alignment cancelling each other out and giving the object a net-zero magnetic field. 
- in presence of an external magnetic field, magnetic domains align with each other. 
- the internal magnetic field created by these aligned domains is very storng. 
- This internal magnetic field increases the external magnetic field. 

**Strengthening an Electromagnet**

Stacked loops of wire connected to the ends of a battery create a weak magnetic field. A much stronger magnetic field is created when the same loops of wire are wrapped around an iron nail. 

- the nail is ferromagnetic. 
- The magnetic domains in ferromagnetic materials align in the presence of an external magnetic field, strengthening the external magnetic field. 
- the iron nail increases the magnetic field created by the loops of wire and the battery. 
- iron has a high relative permeability. 
- relative permeability describes a materials ability to form internal magnetic fields. 
- The nail was able to form a strong internal magnetic field in the presence of an external magnetic field. 

### Takeaways 
- `magnetic permeability` describes a substance's ability to form internal magnetic fields
- `paramagnetism` is weak attraction to a magnetic field that some materials experience due to magnetic dipole moments from electrons spin 
- `ferromagnetic` substances have an inherent magnetic field due to the alignment of their magnetic domains. 

## 12.2 Magnetism and Moving charges 

### 12.2.1 see how a moving charge carrier produces a magnetic field and use the right hand rule to determine its direction. 

- Moving charge carriers produce magnetic fields
- The magnitude of a magnetic field is defined by the Biot-Savart Law: 

$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{Id\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$$

- `dB` is the direction of the magnetic field aka direction of the thumb
- $Id\vec{l}$ is the direction of the current (aka direction of motion of a positive charge), align with pointer finger
- $\hat{r}$ is the direction of the radius, middle finger pointing out at 90 degrees to palm
- $r^2$ is the square of the distance from the charged object to the point where the field is measured 

**Magnetic Fields**
- B is the direction of the magnetic field 
- v is in the direction of the moving charge 
- $\hat{r}$ is the direction of the radius. 
- then the equation of direction is
$$\mathbf{B = v \times \hat{r}}$$

**Right hand rule 1**
- the velocity, $\vec{v}$, is the pointer finger
- the radius, $\vec{r}$, is the middle finger 
- the thumb, $\vec{B}$, is the direction of the magnetic field
- Negatively charged objects have the opposite sign compared to positive charges 
- the magnetic field created by a moving negatively charged object will have the opposite direction of the magnetic field created by a positively charged object. 
- if you need the direction of the magnetic field from negative charge use right hand rule but point in opposite. direction of thumb. 

**Another right hand rule**

- point the `thumb` in the direction  of the object's velocity. 
- your fingers curl in the direction that the field circles around the moving charged object. 


### 12.2.2 define the force a charged particle experiences as it moves through a magnetic field and practice using the right hand rule to determine its direction. 

**Magnetic Force**

The magnetic force acting on a charged object is given by 

$$\mathbf{\vec{F_B} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}}$$

The direction of the magnetic force acting on a moving charged object can be found using the right hand rule. 

$$\mathbf{F_B = qvBsin\theta}$$

**Positively charged object moving in a field**

A positively charge object is moving at a speed of v to the right in a region of space with a uniform magnetic field of magnitude B directed out of the page.

What is the radius of the circle the object moves in?

$$\sum F = ma$$
$$F_B = m*a_c$$
$$qvB = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

The force on a negatively charged object opposite force on positively charged object

### Takeaways 
- Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charged particles 
- the direction of the magnetic force on a moving positively charged object can be found using the right hand rule. 
$$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$
- The magnitude of the magnetic force is defined by: $F_B = qvBsin\theta$
- The magnetic force is perpendicular to the object's velocity: 
  - It can only change the object's direction, not the object's speed 
  - It does no work. 

### 12.2.3 analyze the motion of a charged particle in a region of space containing both an electric field and a magnetic field. 

**Electric Force**

The electric force, $F_E$, on a positively charged object will be in the same direction as the electric field $\vec{E}$. 

$$F_E = qE$$

**Crossed Fields**

A particle moves through a region of space that contains both an electric field and a magnetic field. 

When these forces have the same magnitude and point in opposite directions the particle will be undeflected and move with a constant velocity 

This velocity can be found by setting the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic forces equal to each other. 

$$F_E = F_B$$
$$qE = qvB => v = \frac{E}{B}$$

If the particle moves faster than this velocity, the magnetic force will be greater than the electric force, and the particle will be deflected downward. 

**The Hall effect**

- current in the circuit moves clockwise. The current through the flat section of wire shown moves toward the bottom of the page. The electrons in the wire move in the opposite direction of conventional current. 
- An external `magnetic field` is directed out of the page. 
- electrons will be deflected to the `left side` of the wire by the magnetic field. 
- as charge carriers gather on the left side of the wire, they experience a repelling electric force that balances the magnetic force. 
- the electric field in the wire points to the left as a result of the magnetic field being applied. 

### Takeaways 
- In a region containing both a magnetic and an electric field, a moving charged object will experience independent forces from each field. 
- if these forces are balanced on an object, the object will move through the region undeflected, with a constant velocity. 
- a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to a current carrying wire will produce an electric field in the wire perpendicular to the current
  
## 12.3 Magnetic Fields of Current carrying wires and the biot savart law
### 12.3.1 Examine magnetic forces on current carrying wires and predict how the force will change due to altering the current, orientation or field strength. 

**Learning Objective**

Describe the force exerted on current carrying wires by a manetic field
- $d\vec{F_B} = I(d\vec{l} \times \vec{B})$
- $d\vec{F_B} =$ Force on small segment of wire $d\vec{l}$ due to magnetic field $\vec{B}$
- to find the net force on the wire 
$$\vec{F_B} = \int d\vec{F_B}$$
$$\vec{F_B} = \int I(d\vec{l} \times \vec{B})$$

$$F_B = \int_0^l IB\sin\theta \, dl$$
$$F_B = I\cdot B\cdot l\sin\theta$$

### 12.3.2 discover that a current carrying wire produces a magnetic field in the space around it and learn about the strength and direction of the magnetic field. 

**Claim: A current carrying wire will produce a magnetic field**

`Question`: Can you design a quick experiment using equipment commonly found in a high school physics lab that could verify this claim?

**What equipment would you need?**
- voltage source 
- resistor  (to limit current)
- wire 
- compass
  
**What would you do with it?**
- Place compass near the wire with no current flowing
- Generate current and see if the compass needle is deflected
- repeat trying different orientations

**How would you know if a magnetic field was present?**
use the compass to detect magnetic field of wire if position wire straight up

**claim**: a current carrying wire will produce a magnetic field forming concentric circles around the wire. 

**Direction of the magnetic field around a wire**

You can use your right hand to predic the direction of the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire. 

- Point your right thumb in the direction of the current. 
- the fingers of your right hand will now curl in the direction of the circular magnetic field. 

**Claim:** The magnetic field created by a long, stright, current-carrying wire will be directly proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire. 

### Takeaways 
- Given the idea that moving charges create magnetic fields it follow that current flowing in a wire will produce a magnetic field. 
- the magnetic fields lines are concentric circles centered on the wire. The magnetic field vectors are tangent to the field lines. 
- The field has no component toward, away from or parallel to the segment of wire creating the field. 
- the direction of the magnetic field can be found by a variation of the right hand rule. 
field grows stronger with more current and weaker as you move away from the wire. 

### 12.3.3 use the Biot savart law to derive the magnetic field of a long, straight current carrying wire and the field at the center of a current carrying loop

- Current flowing in a wire will produce a magnetic field. 
- The magnetic field lines are concentric circles (closed loops) centered on the wire. The magnetic field vectors are tangent to the field lines. 

**Biot Savart Equation**

Used to find the magnetic field of an infinitesimally small segment of a current carrying wire. 

$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I(d\vec{l}\times \hat{r})}{r^2}$$

This can be integrated to find 
- the magnetic field of a long straight current-carrying wire. 
- the magnetic field at the center of a single loop of current-carrying wire. 

$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I(d\vec{l}\times \hat{r})}{r^2} => \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int \frac{I\sin\theta dl}{r^2}$$

**Derive the magnetic field of a long straight wire**

Biot Savart Law: $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I(d\vec{l}\times \hat{r})}{r^2}$

Integrate both sides to get  $|\vec{B}| = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int \frac{I\sin\theta dl}{r^2}$

apply to a long straight wire: 

$$|\vec{B_P}| = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r_{\perp}}$$

- The magnetic field of a long straight wire is directly proportional to the current in the wire and inversely proportional to the distance, $r_{\perp}$ from the wire. 
- Direction of magnetic field at point P is found by using a variation of right hand rule

**Magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying loop**

- Compasss points north when no current flowing. 
- Compass changes direction in response to the current. 
- At the center of the loop, the magnetic field created is parallel to the axis of the loop. 

**Magnetic field of a single loop of wire**
- each tiny section of wire creates its own magnetic field. 
- These will add together to create the net magnetic field as described by the principle of superposition. 
- In the center the magnetic field from each tiny element will be equal due to symmetry
- use calculus to find the net magnetic field at the center. 
- the direction can be found with your right hand. 
- for a loop you can curl your right-hand fingers in the direction of the current, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. 

## 12.4 Ampere's Law 

### 12.4.1 Define Ampere's law and use it to derive the field strength of a long current carrying wire.

`Ampere's Law` relates the magnetic field created in space to the current enclosed by an imaginary closed path called an Amperian loop. 

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl} = \mu_0I_{enc} + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{d\phi_E}{dt}$$ 

- $\oint$ Closed line integral around the Amperian loop 
- $\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl}$ Dot product of the magnetic field and a tiny element of the Amperian loop
- $\mu_0I_{enc}$ The product of the permeability of freespace and the current flowing through (enclosed by) the amperian loop
- $\mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{d\phi_E}{dt}$ is the "Maxwells extension" to Ampere's law. You should understand that a charging electric field generates a magnetic field which is what this term represents. 

**Ampere's Law**

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl} = \mu_0I_{enc}$$
Ampere's law  may only be used in highly symmetric situations for which the line integral may be easily evaluated. 

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl} = \mu_0I_{enc} $$
$$\oint Bdl\cos\theta = \mu_0I_{enc} $$
$$ B\cos0\oint dl = \mu_0I_{enc} $$

### Takeaways 
- Amperian loop is chosen by us and must be a closed path 
- in general, line integrals are difficult to evaluate and mostly beyond the scope of this class. 
- In certain situations, a carefully chosen Amperian loop will allow the line integral to be evaluated easily. 
- A good Amperian loop has a magnetic field that is constant in magnitude and parallel to the Amperian loop or has the magnetic field perpendicular to the Amperian loop
-  can't use Amperes law to find the magnetic field at the center of a single current carrying loop. magnetic field is neither constant nor parallel at every point on the loop.

### 12.4.2 use Ampere's law to create a graph of the magnetic field of a coaxial wire. 

**Ampere's Law**' relates the magnetic field created in space to the current enclosed by an imaginary closed path called an Amperian loop.

**What is a Coaxial Wire**

- A type of electrical cable. 
- Features an inner conducting core, separated from an outer concentric conducting sheath. 
- Used for signal transmission such as cable TV, audio, internet, radio antenna connections, musical instruments. 

**Magnetic Field of a coaxial wire**

Sketch a graph of the magnetic field of a current carrying coaxial wire as a function of radius. 

- Use Ampere's law to determine the magnetic field as a function of radius in each of 4 distinct regions. 
- Inner core $r < a$ requires using current density of core to find $I_{enc}$ 
- Gap between wires $a < r < b$ enclosed current is $+I$
- Inside outer sheath $b < r < c$ requires using current density of outer sheath to find $I_{enc}$
- Outside everything $r > c, I_{enc} = 0$

### Takeaways
- Using ampere's law to find magnetic field strength depends on symmetry 
- to simplify $\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l}$ check the following conditions
- Magnetic field is constant over the integration path(unless $\theta = 90\degree$) 
- magnetic field is at a constant angle to the integration path (usually parallel $0\degree$)

## 12.4 Ampere's Law 

### 12.4.1 apply Ampere's law to calculate the number of turns in a solenoid. 

**What is a Solenoid?**

A solenoid is an electrical device formed out of a tightly wound helical coil of wire
- The length of the solenoid is typically much larger than its diameter
- each individual loop contributes to the magnetic field inside the coils. 
- when current flows, a solenoid becomes an electromagnet. 

**Demonstration of magnetic field of solenoid**
- no magnetic field outside of solenoid. 
- magnetic field inside is parallel to axis of solenoid when current is flowing. 

**Magnetic field of a solenoid**

To Find the direction of the magnetic field...
- Use the right hand 
- curl fingers in the direction current flows through the loop 
- your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid. 

**How many turns are there?**

- Current = 2.33A
- Length of Solenoid = 11.5cm = 0.115m 
- Magnetic field strength = 5.78mT at end of solenoid

**Make a plan to find the number of turns**

- choose an appropriate amperian loop
  - B field must be constant in magnitude and parallel or perpendicular to the loopat all points. 

**find the current enclosed**

Each loop of wire has the same current flowing through it. 

$$I_enc = I\cdot n \cdot w$$

n = number of turns per unit length of the solenoid. 

w = the width of the amperian loop. 

### Takeaways 
- A solenoid is made from a long wire coiled many times to form a tube. 
- solenoids are electromagnets and have lots of industrial applications. 
- idea solenoids have no resistance, a constant magnetic field inside and no magnetic field outside
- Amperian loops can be any shape, not just circles. 
- circles and rectangles are the Amperian loops most common in AP Physics C. 
- There is a difference between the total number of turns of a solenoid and the number of turns per unit length. 

$$B_{sol} = \mu_0nI$$
$$n = \text{turns per unit length}$$
$$n = \frac{N}{L}$$
$$N = \frac{B_{sol}L}{\mu_0I}$$
