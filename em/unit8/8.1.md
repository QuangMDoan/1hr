# Electric Charge and Electric Force 

## define fundamental properties of charges and explore electrostatic force behavior qualitatively.

electrons:  negative, $9.11*10^{-31}kg$

protons: positive, $1.67*10^{-27}kg$

charge is a scalar quantity 
elementary charge $ e = 1.6* 10^{-19}$ Coulombs $ (C) $

like charges repel 

opposite charges attract 

closer is more force force acts along line of separation 

The electrostatic force has an inverse square relationship with radius 

Coulombs law 

$\mathbf{F}_E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} $

Key Idea: Electrostatic force is ...
- Directly related to the magnitude of charge 
- inverselfy related to the square of the distance between charges

Electric field: a physical quantity existing in space and time created by charges

Polarized: Induced rearrangement of electrons by an external electric field resulting in a separation of positive and negative charges. 

conductors materials in which charge carriers move easily 

insulators are materials in which charge carriers cannot move easily.
