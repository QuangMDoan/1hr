# Electric Flux 

define electric flux and explore its application through planar areas. 

flux describes the amount of a given effec that passes through a given area. 

### area vectors 

the direction of the area vector is defined as perpendicular to the plane of the surface and outward from a closed surface. 



For an electric field that is constant across a given area, the electric flux through the area is defined as: 

$\phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} $

$$ \phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = |\vec{E}||\vec{A}|cos\theta$$

$\phi_E = $ Electric Flux $(Nm^2/C)$

$ \vec{E} $ = Electric field (N/C)

$ \vec{A} $ = Area ($m^2$)

$\theta = Angle between area and E-field vector$

Is this example maximum or zero flux?

decreasing the area will decrease electric flux 

if you decrease electric field it will decrease the electric flux 

if you change angle from 0 degrees it will decrease electric flux not linearly 

Takeaways; 

- Dot products $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = |\vec{A}||\vec{B}|cos\theta$
- Maximum when parallel, zero when perpendicular 
- Area vectors are defined perpendicular to the surface 
- Electric flux is defined as $\phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} $
- We can change the flux by changing the Area, Electric Field, or Angle 

## Apply the idea of electric flux to non-planar and closed surfaces 
$\phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} $ Only true for an electric field that is constant and at the same angle over the entire area.

### Electric Flux with differential area 

The total electric flux passing through a **surface** is defined by the surface integral over differential sections of surface area. 

$$\mathbf{ \phi_E = \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}}$$

$\phi_E$ = Electric Flux $(Nm^2/C)$

$\vec{A}$ = Electric Field $(N/C)$

$d\vec{A}$ = Differential Area $(m^2)$

Derive the total electric flux through a closed surface, such as a cube with sides of length s if an electric field of magnitude E passes through it perpendicular to one of the faces.
