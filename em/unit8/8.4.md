# Electric Fields of Charge Distributions 

 introduce the integral definition of electric field and use calculus to derve the electric field for a point collinear with a line of charge

## Integral definition of electric field 

$\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int{\frac{dq}{r^2}\hat{r}}$

epsilon: permitivvity of a vacuum

dq -> Differential charge element 

r -> distance between charge element and point in space

$\hat{r}$: "R-hat": unit vector pointing from the charge element ot the point in space 

To use the E-Field integral 

- Draw dq, d_, r, r^ where d_ means dr, ds, dx, $d\theta$, etc
- Write density equation in terms of d_

$\lambda = \frac{dq}{dr} = \frac{Q}{L}$

Substitute known terms into integral equation 

$$ \overrightarrow{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\int{\frac{dq}{r^2}\hat{r}} $$

Known Terms: 

- $\hat{r} = \hat{i}$
- $dq = \frac{Q}{L}dr$

Factor out constants

Write bounds 

Integrate 

When making sketches, think of "edge conditions" and it may help generate a general shape of the sketch.

**explore the resultant electric fields at the center of a semicircular arc while changing the amount of arc that is missing**

A ring has a radius R and a linear charge density $\lambda$. What is the electric field at the center of the ring?

ring is missing 60 degrees on right side. What is the electric field at the center of the arc?

Conceptualize before you solve!

Symmetry is there to help!

Follow a procedure each time you solve problems to reinforce similarities.
