# Unit 2 Force and Translational Dynamics 

## 2.1 Systems and Center of Mass

### 2.1.1 Define the center of mas and learn how to diagram with a labeled center of mass. 

**Connection to projectile motion**

If I toss an on object upward at an angle, what will its path look like? 
- It's path will be parabolic. 

What happens if, instead, a system of particles is tossed upward at the same angle? (think: ladder ball game)
- The system will move as if an external force were applied to a single particle of mass M, the total mass of the system, located at the average position of mass in the system, also known as the center of mass. 

**Locating Center of Mass**
`Symmetrical objects of uniform density`
- If the object is symmetrical, its COM is along a line of symmetry. 

**COM Example**

A firecracker tossed into the air at an angle suddenly explodes into several fragments. What can be said about the motion of the center of mass of the systemmade up of all the fragments after the explosion. 

**Locating the center of mass mathematically**

The coordinates of the center of mass of a system of particles can be found with this equation: 
$$x_{cm} = \frac{\sum m_ix_i}{\sum m_i}$$
$$y_{cm} = \frac{\sum m_iy_i}{\sum m_i}$$


**Center of mass remains at rest unless there is a net external force applied**

A person is standing at one end of a uniform raft of length L that is floating motionless on water, as shown above. The center of mass of the person-raft system is a distance, d, from the center of the raft. The person then walks to the other end of the raft. 

If friction between the raft and the water is negligible how far does the raft move relative to the water. 

### 2.1.3 use calculus to qualitatively determine the location of the center of mass of a nonuniform rod. 

$$x_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int xdm$$
$$y_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int ydm$$

$$\int dm = M = \text{total mass of the object}$$

**Center of Mass of a Thin Rod of Uniform Density**

Find the center of mass of a thin rod of uniform density with length l and mass M

$$\text{linear density} = \lambda = \frac{M}{l} = \frac{dm}{dx}$$

## 2.2 Forces and free body diagrams

### 2.2.1 describe forces and use a free body diagram to analyze situations in which multiple forces are acting on an object. 

- center of mass is average position of mass of an object or system of objects 
- cneter of mass is center of gravity. 
- gravity

**Types of Forces**

A `contact force` occurs between two macroscopic objects that "touch" or come into contact with each other.

Examples: 
- Applied, $F_A$
- Resistive Force, $F_r$, or sliding on a rough surface and air resistance are types of resistive forces. 
- Normal, $F_N$(support force of a surface)
- Tension, $F_T$(from a string or rope)

A `field force` occurs when an object interacts with one of the following fields. 
- electric field: $F_E$ is a electric force
- magnetic field: $F_B$ is a magnetic force 
- gravitational field: $F_g$ any object with mass will feel a force if in a gravitational field 

Contact forces, when analyzed on the microscopic level are the result of electromagnetic forces. The atoms within objects are bonded together via electrons. 

`Free-body diagrams` are used to analyze all the forces acting on an object so that we can determine the net force and thus the subsequent motion of the object. 

### 2.2.2 we will use a free body diagram to analyze situations in which some of the forces acting on an object may need to be broken up into vector components. 

**Forces at an Angle**

Sometimes, forces are nto directed along the x-axis or y-axis. analyze components of those forces in those directions. if the forces in the x-direction are balanced, there is no acceleration of the object or system in x-direction. if forces in y direction are balanced no acceleration of object or system in y direction. 

**Objects on an Incline**

Sometimes it is useful to change the orientation of our coordinate axes. Suppose a box was sliding down a ramp at constant velocity; draw a free-body diagram of the forces acting on the block. 

### Takeaways 

- FBD are used to analyze all the forces acting on an object so that we can determine the net force and thus the subsequent motion of the object. 
- Sometimes the force vectors need to be broken up into x and y components so the net force in the x-direction and y-direction can be analyzed. 
- sometimes it is useful to change the orientation of our coordinate axes, for example when we have an incline or ramp. 

### 2.2.3 Free body diagrams for situations in which multiple objects are analyzed. 

## 2.3 Newton's Third Law 

### 2.3.1 discuss Newton's three laws of motion and then focus on applying the third law as we explore paired forces in a variety of scenarios. 

- `Newtons 1st Law`: if the net force exerted on a system is zero, the velocity of that system will remain constant. 
- `Newton's 2nd Law`: $\sum F = F_{net} = m\mathbf{a}$
- `Newton's 3rd Law`: Whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object. The force objects exert on each other are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

## 2.4 Newton's First Law 

### 2.4.1 discuss problem solving procedures for this unit and analyze the forces exerted on an object hung from two slanted strings. 

- `Newtons 1st Law`: if the net force exerted on a system is zero, the velocity of that system will remain constant. 
  -   if at rest stays at rest 
  -   if in motion continues to move at same velociy. 

**Problem-Solving procedures**
- identify direction of acceleration 
  - if direction is not obvious, proceed to the next steps. 
- Draw free body diagram(s) or force diagram(s) 
  -  for a two dimensional scenario, select a convenient coordinate system to use. It is usually convenient to have one axis lined up with the direction of acceleration. 
  - Resolve slanted vector(s) in the chosen coordinate system into components 
- Write $\sum F = F_{net} = m\mathbf{a}$
  - if in two dimensions, write one $F_{net} = ma$ for each dimension. 
- Solve for what you need

### 2.4.2 follow problem-solving procedures to analyze the motion of an object with forces that are balanced in one dimension and unbalanced forces in another. 

### 2.4.3 follow problem-solving procedures to analyze the forces acting on objects with velocities that remain constant. 

## 2.5 Newton's Second Law 

### 2.5.1 apply Newton's second law to analyze the forces involved in single object systems and in multiple object systems. 

- `Newton's second law`: $\sum F = F_{net} = m\mathbf{a}$
  -   $\sum F = F_{net} =$ the sum  of `force vectors` 
  -   $F_{net}$ and acceleration ($\mathbf{a}$) are always in the same direction. 

- 80N monkey wants to climb down a vine hanging from a tall tree. The monkey does not know that this vine can only support up to 78N of tension without breaking. 
- Is it possible for the monkey to go down the vine without breaking it? If yes, how can the monkey do so?
- Because the vine can only handle 78N of tension, the monkey must have a downward acceleration of at least 0.25m/s^2 to avoid breaking the vine. 

### 2.5.2 create a graph using experimental data, use a graph feature to find g, and predict how the graph would change when the experimental setting is modified. 

### 2.5.3 Apply problem solving procedures to investigate the forces involved in a pulley problem and a multi-object scenario involving an incline. 

## 2.6 Gravitational Force 

### 2.6.1 investigate the universal gravitational force equation and how the concept applies to all objects with mass. 

$$F_{G} = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
$$G = 6.67*10^{-11}(N \cdot m^2)/kg^2$$

### 2.6.2 compare the universal gravitation equation to the force of gravity equation and introduce the concept of gravitational field. 

**Gravitational field**
- A field models the effects of a noncontact force, such as gravity, exerted on an object at various positions. 
- A field can be depicted by a vector map, which shows the magnitude and direction of the force at various positions. 
- The arrows on the vector map shown represent the force of gravity at various locations near a mass, m. 

- The magnitude of the gravitational field, $\vec{g}$, is
$$|\vec{g}| = \frac{|\vec{F_g}|}{m} = \frac{(\frac{GMm}{r^2})}{m} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
- If the gravitational force is the only force exerted on an object, then ... 
$$F_{net} = F_g$$
$$ma = G\frac{mM}{r^2}$$
$$a = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$
$$a = g$$


### 2.6.3 describe situations in which gravitational force will be considered constant. 

### 2.6.4 investigate apparent weight of an object due to exerted gravitational force, and we will describe the differences between inertial mass and gravitational mass.

- weight is pull of ravity on mass 
- W = mg
- Weigth can change from location to location based on gravitational field 
- for an object on a level surface, weight equal to magnitude of normal force. 
- apparent weight is mass of an object multiplied by vector difference between gravitational acceleration of location and acceleration of the object. 

**Equivalence Principle**
- equivalence principle states observer in noninertial reference frame is unable to distinguish between an object's apparent weight and the actual gravitational force exerted on the object by a gravitational field. 

**Inertial mass**
- Newton's first law of motion states that an object in motion will remain in motion, or an object at rest will remain at rest. 
- This resistance to changes in motion by an object is known as inertia. 
- The amount an object's motion changes is related to the net force exerted on the object and inertial mass of the object. 
$$a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$$

**Inertial Mass vs. Gravitational Mass**
- inertial mass and gravitational have been verified to be equivalent and satisfy conservation principles. 
- The difference between inertial mass and gravitational mass is how they're calculated. 
- Inertial mass uses Newton's second law, F=ma, and measuring the acceleration of a known force applied to a unknown mass
- Gravitational mass compares the measurement of the force of gravity on a known mass to the force of gravity on an unknown mass 
$$F_{net} = F_g$$
$$m_{inertial}a = m_{gravitational}g$$
$$m_{inertial} = m_{gravitational}$$
$$a = g \approx 10m/s^2$$

### 2.6.5 describe gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere on an interacting object and disover that the force exerted is proportional to the distance between the sphere and the object. 

### Takeaways
- Whena an object is located outside a uniform sphere or spherical shell, the net gravitational force can be calculated by treating the sphere/shell as if all of its mass were located at its center. 
- When an object is located inside a uniform sphere, only the partial mass of the sphere contributes to the net gravitational force. 

### 2.6.6 discover gravitational force exerted on an object by a sphere with uniform density is proportional to the object's distance from the center of the sphere. 

## 2.9 Resistive Forces

### 2.9.1 define a Resistive force, as well as investigate the behavior of these forces and how they affect the motion of an object over time. 

- Resistive force: A velocity-dependent force that resists the motion of an object
  - Examples: Air resistance, drag force. 
  - proportional in strength to the velocity. 
  - opposite in direction to the velocity. 
$$\vec{F_r} = -k\vec{v}$$

**Resistive Forces and Newton's Second Law**
$$\sum F = ma = mg-kv$$

### 2.9.2 derive a function for the velocity of an object experiencing a resistive force by setting up and solving a differential equation

**Writing the Differential Equation**
$$\sum F = ma = mg-kv$$
$$a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
$$m\frac{dv}{dt} = mg-kv$$

### 2.9.3 define terminal velocity for an object experiencing a resistive force and derive an expression for terminal velocity. 

- `Terminal Velocity`: The speed an object reaches falling through the atmosphere under the influence of a constant force, gravity and an opposing velocity-dependent resisitve force, air resistance

-`Terminal velocity` occurs when the resistive force is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, to the other, constant force. 

**Determining Terminal Velocity: Method 1**

$$\sum F = 0 = mg - kv_T$$
$$v_T = \frac{mg}{k}$$

**Determining Terminal Velocity: Method 2**
$$v(t) = \frac{mg}{k}(1-e^{-\frac{k}{m}t})$$

### 2.9.4 investigate the motion of an object experiencing a resistive force by deriving and graphing kinetmatic equations. 

**Graphing velocity vs. Time**
- at t = 0, v(0) = 0 
- after a long time the object reaches terminal velocity. 
- as t increases, accleration approaches zero. 

$$v(t) = \frac{mg}{k}(1-e^{-\frac{k}{m}t})$$

**Deriving a function for acceleration**

$$v(t) = \frac{mg}{k}(1-e^{-\frac{k}{m}t})$$
$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
$$a(t) = ge^{-\frac{k}{m}t}$$

**Deriving a function for position**
$$x(t) = \int v(t) dt$$
$$x(t) = \frac{mg}{k}(t+\frac{m}{k}e^{-\frac{k}{m}t}) + x_0$$

### Takeaways 

- The graph of position vs. time can be found by setting $x = \int vdt;$ has an initial slope equal to the initial velocity; has an x-intercept equal to the initial position; and, as time increases, approaches a constant slope equal to the terminal velocity $\frac{mg}{k}$.
- The graph of velocity vs. time is asymptotic to the terminal velocity $v_T = \frac{mg}{k}$

## 2.10 Circular Motion 

### 2.10.1 consider circular motion at constant speed and at changing speed. relate the motion to the directions of velocity, force and acceleration. 

**Constant speed, circular path**
- A `thought experiment`: ball on a string, swinging about a pivot, no friction. 
- In space: no air resistance or gravity. 
- Already swinging: stays at constant speed 
- Direction of ball's v at the instant shown?
- `v` is instantaneously tangential to path 
- FBD of ball at this instant?

**Constant speed, circular path, cont**

- Is there a net force on the ball at this instant? 
  - Yes!
- In what direction? 
  - centripetal: "towards the center"
- Not a feature of this example, but...
  - centrifugal: "away from the center"
- Direction of balls acceleration at this instant 
  - towards the center
- if the ball has (centripetal) acceleration, how can its velocity be constant? 
  - velocity isn't constant here. 
  - speed (magnitude of velocity) is constant, 
  - but the direction of velocity is changing. 

### 2.10.2 derive, then deploy, a math model for uniform circular motion. We'll also relate radius, speed, acceleration and period. 

**A "circle of velocity"**

- Velocity vectors make a circle 
- `a` is the derivative of `v`; `a` is tangent to v's circle

**Period**
`T = "period" = time to complete one cycle (around the circle)`

$$v = \frac{\text{distance traveled in one circle}}{\text{time to complete one circle}}$$
$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{t}$$
$$a_c = \frac{2\pi v}{T}$$
$$a_c = \frac{2\pi (\frac{2\pi r}{T})}{T}$$
$$a_c = \frac{4\pi r^2}{T^2}$$

### Takeaways
$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{t}$$
$$a_c = \frac{2\pi v}{T}$$
$$a_c = \frac{4\pi r^2}{T^2}$$
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
