# 20: solving higher order nonhomogeneous equations: Undetermined coefficients

## 20.1: Method of undetermined coefficents 
- Works well when the equation has constant coefficients and a non-homogeneous term which is a sum or product of polynomials, sines, cosines, or exponential functions. 
- Use the general form of the non-homogeneous term as the form for a particular solution. 
- If $L[y] = a_0y^{(n)} + ... + a_{n-1}y' + a_ny$ then 
$$L[\text{polynomials}] = \text{polynomials}$$
$$L[\text{exponentials}] = \text{exponentials}$$
$$L[\text{sine or cosines}] = \text{Lin. comb. of sines and cosines}$$
## 20.2: g = nonhomogeneous term in some constant coefficeint ODE.
- If g = deg. m poly, try as a solution
$$Y(x) = A_0x^m + A_1x^{m-1} + ... + A_{m-1}x + A_m$$
- If $g = (\text{deg. m poly})e^{\alpha x}$, try as a solution
$$Y(x) = e^{\alpha x}(A_0x^m + A_1x^{m-1} + ... + A_{m-1}x + A_m)$$
