This book covers full range of concepts tested on the digital SAT. 

The books show how to apply those concepts to the specific ways in which they are tested on the exam. 

Instead of providing explanations and examples for a simple version of a rule and leaving readers to deduce its subtler or more complex applications, this book walks readers through multiple version of each concept, showing us how it can be tested from various angles and in combination with other concepts.

The chapters are organized in roughly the order of the frequency with which the concepts appear on the test. 

First focus on Parts I and II, as the principles covered there make up the vast majority of writing questions. 

while the shorter writing portion on the digital SAT may make the testing process less tedious, the downside to this change is that each question counts more. 

To get a high score, you must be prepared to encounter questions testing a fiarly wider ange of conecepts, even if only a small number of them will appear on the exam. 

Although the majority of questions focus on a few key areas, the remaining items are likely to be drawn from a fairly broad pool. 

The tests, after all, cannot be made too predictable. Moreover, because of the adaptive nature of the exam, it is crucial you answer as many questions as possible correctly in the first section, and there is no reason to lose what can be easy points.
