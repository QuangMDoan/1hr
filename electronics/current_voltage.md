# SI system

- Charge, unit = Coulomb, aka C, $ 6.24*10^{18} $ electrons
- Energy, unit = Joule, aka J, 1 N*m
- Current, unit = Ampere, aka A, 1 C/s
- Voltage, unit = Volt, aka V, 1 J/C
- Power, unit = Watt, W, 1 J/s

Joule is a measure of work or energy. One J is the amount of energy or work of a 1 N force applied for a 1m distance.

current is measured in amperes (A). 1 A is equal to 1 C/s or the flow of $6.24 * 10^{18}$ electrons per second past a point of reference. 

The fundamental unit of electromotive force is named the **volt**. voltage is the potential difference between two points on a circuit. If you were to move 1 coulomb of charge while expending 1 joule of energy between any two points in space then the potential difference is 1 volt.

A watt is a measure of energy expended per second. Aka watt is the instant rate of energy or the derivative of energy with respect to time.

# atomic theory

general current flow in a conductor with a electric field applied. 

# Current and Voltage
the amount of charge q electrons that passes point p as a funciton of time defines the current.
Current is equal to the amount of charger per unit time

$i = \frac{dq}{dt}$
1 C of charge per second is equivalent to 1 ampere

## Voltage Uncovered 
voltage is a manifestation of electric field. every single charge in the universe creates an electric field when you place number of charges together they create an electric field that is the sum of the individual electric fields. 

Voltage is potential energy per unit charge
$V = \frac{U}{q0}$

Change in potential 
Change in $V = dV = \frac{dU}{q0}$

Since potential energy is measured in joules, and the charge q0 is represented by coulombs therefore 1 volt is defined as
$ 1V = \frac{1J}{1C} $

in other words 1 J of energy must be used to move 1 C of charge through a potential difference or voltage of 1 V. And that's voltage!
